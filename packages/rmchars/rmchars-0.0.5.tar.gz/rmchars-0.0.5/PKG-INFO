Description: # RECURSIVELY REMOVE INVALID CHARS IN PATHS
        
        A simple script to find and remove invalid characters in file and directory
        names. Inspired by the need to workaround limitations of [Egnyte's unsupported
        character types](https://helpdesk.egnyte.com/hc/en-us/articles/201637074-Unsupported-Characters-and-File-Types).
        
        The chars are currently hardcoded into the script, but like the list of servers
        to run on, this should really be added to a config/lst file.
        
        The aforementioned list should reside in $HOME/.ELC.lst. The format is one line
        per server and lines beginning with # will be ignored.
        
        There is a really convoluted bash version and a nice simple Python version and a
        W.I.P Powershell version...
        
        run.sh is a bash wrapper script for mounting a list of servers to run the python
        script on.
        
        ## INSTALLATION
        
        `pip install rmchars`
        
        ## CLI USAGE
        
        ```
        usage: rmchars [-h] (-i | -a | -t | -q | -f) [path]
        
        Remove invalid characters from a given path.
        
        positional arguments:
          path               a valid path
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help         show this help message and exit
          -i, --interactive  prompt before renaming each path
          -a, --automate     rename each path without prompting
          -t, --dry_run      preform a dry run to see what would be renamed
          -q, --quiet        run silently
          -f, --find         print a list of invalid paths
        ```
        
        ## TODO
        
        - [x] ~~Add support for unicode and control characters~~
        - [ ] Add char list to config file
        - [ ] Finish Powershell version
