        This is a framework where you define a Service Catalog portfolio, products and versions using YAML. For versions of your 
        products you specify where the source code for them can be found and the framework publishes the portfolio, products and 
        versions in every* AWS Region after validating, linting and testing them.

        ![whatisthis](./docs/whatisthis.png)
        
        You build products in a central hub account using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild, you then deploy them into AWS 
        Service Catalog in every enabled region of your hub account using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CloudFormation. 
        
        ## Getting started
        
        Follow the steps below to get started:
        
        ### Install the tool
        Optional, but recommended:
        ```bash
        virtualenv --python=python3.7 venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
        
        Install the package:
        ```bash
        pip install aws-service-catalog-factory==0.1.15
        ```
        
        ### Bootstrap your account
        Create the AWS CodeCommit repo and AWS CodePipeline resources to run the factory:
        ```bash
        servicecatalog-factory bootstrap 0.1.15
        ```
        
        ### Setup your factory
        Clone the configuration repo and configure your factory:
        ```bash
        git clone --config 'credential.helper=!aws codecommit credential-helper $@' --config 'credential.UseHttpPath=true' https://git-codecommit.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/ServiceCatalogFactory
        servicecatalog-factory seed simple ServiceCatalogFactory
        cd ServiceCatalogFactory
        git add .
        git commit -am "initial add"
        git push
        ```
        Wait for pipeline to complete and you have a working factory.
        
        ### Setup your first product
        Create your first product in your account:
        ```bash
        aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name account-iam
        git clone --config 'credential.helper=!aws codecommit credential-helper $@' --config 'credential.UseHttpPath=true' https://git-codecommit.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/account-iam
        cd account-iam
        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eamonnfaherty/cloudformation-templates/master/iam_admin_role/product.template.yaml -o product.template.yaml
        git checkout -b v1
        git add .
        git commit -am "initial add"
        git push --set-upstream origin v1
        ```
        Wait for the product pipeline to complete and you have a Service Catalog product ready to deploy in each region of your
        account.
