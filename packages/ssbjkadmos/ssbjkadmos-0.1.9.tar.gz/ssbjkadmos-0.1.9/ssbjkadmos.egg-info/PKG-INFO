Description: Introduction
        =============
        
        SSBJ(SuperSonic Business Jet)-KADMOS(Knowledge- and graph-based Agile Design for Multidisciplinary Optimization System) is a small repository containing tools defined by NASA for the analysis of an SSBJ. The tools have been defined by NASA, were developed in Python by ONERA and have been KADMOSized by TU Delft.
