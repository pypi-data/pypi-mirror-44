eboxbw
======

**eboxbw** is a Python 3 package and a command line interface for
getting [Electronic Box](http://www.electronicbox.net/) cable Internet
bandwidth usage (Qu√©bec only). It is based on
[this tool](http://consocable.electronicbox.net/index.php?lng=en).

eboxbw supports Electronic Box's _Super off peak_ option.


reliability
-----------

Unfortunately, Electronic Box does not provide any sort of public API
to obtain a user's bandwidth usage data; eboxbw has to rely on parsing
the web interface's HTML output. This exact HTML output changes from
time to time, when Electronic Box decides so, which often results in
eboxbw not working anymore.

There have been several attempts to ask Electronic Box to create a
public API, but so far they won't.
