csv-to-sqlite
=============

This is a simple script that takes CSV files as input and copies their contents into a SQLite database. .
(Column names are taken from the headers (first row) in the csv file.) 
Intended for **Python 3**. (I know it *did* run on Py2 as some people tried, but I haven't tested it.)
