Deepdrive API
=============

Python implementation of Deepdrive API used to run agents within the [Deepdrive sim](https://github.com/deepdrive/deepdrive-sim) over the network.

The Deepdrive sim server accepts messages over ZMQ serialized with Apache Arrow, allowing agents to be written in any language that also supports these libs.

To install the package, run: `pip3 install deepdrive-api`
