Since `ampdup` is\n`async`/`await`-based this loop can easily run concurrently with other\noperations.\n\n```\nasync def observe_state():\n    async with IdleClient.make('localhost', 6600) as i:\n        while True:\n            changed = await i.idle()\n            handle_changes(changed)\n```\n\nTodo\n====\n\n- [ ] Support command lists.\n- [ ] Support connecting through Unix socket.\n- [ ] Support the more obscure MPD features such as partitions.\n",
