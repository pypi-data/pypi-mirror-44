Description: # mdio
        
        A library of simple I/O routines for MD trajectory formats.
        
        *mdio* is designed to provide basic MD file I/O capabilities. It's not supposed
        to replace great packages like *mdtraj* and *mdanalysis*, but may be useful
        when all you need is basic MD trajectory file I/O and nothing much more.
        
        Currently mdio supports reading and writing dcd, xtc, and Amber netcdf (.nc) format files.
        
        ## Installation:
        
        Easiest via pip:
        
        ```
        % pip install mdio
        ```
        
        ## Usage:
        
        *mdio* provides three basic functions: *xtc_open()*, *dcd_open()*, and *nc_open()*. Reading and writing is done via *Frame* objects that
        wrap the key data (coordinates, box info, timepoint). 
        
        **Be aware:** *mdio* makes no assumptions about units - it's up to the user to
        provide data in angstroms or nanometers, etc., as required.
        
        
        ### Example 1: reading a dcd format file:
        ```
        from mdio.dcdio import dcd_open
        
        f = dcd_open('mydcdfile.dcd') # default is to open in "read" mode
        frame = f.read_frame() # returns a frame object
        coordinates = frame.crds # an [N, 3] numpy array
        box = frame.box # a [3,3] numpy array
        time = frame.time # time point (float) - in whatever units the dcd file used.
        
        while frame is not None:
            frame = f.read_frame() # returns None at the end of the file
        f.close()
        
        ```
        
        ### Example 2: writing a .nc format file:
        
        ```
        from mdio.ncio import nc_open
        from mdio.base import Frame
        import numpy as np
        
        natoms = 100
        crds = np.random.rand(natoms, 3)
        box = np.identity(3) * 40.0
        time = 1.0
        
        myframe = Frame(crds, box=box, time=time) # crds is the only mandatory argument; box can be None and time defaults to 1.0
        with nc_open('myncfile.nc', 'w') as f: # context managers supported
            f.write_frame(frame)
        	
        ```
        
        ### Example 3: reading an xtc format file:
        
        Xtc format files are handled analogously to dcd and nc format ones, but in addition it is possible to restrict reading 
        to an initial subset of all the atoms (e.g. maybe the trajectory is of a solvated system of a total of 10,000 atoms, but
        the solute is just the first 200 atoms). This can increase reading performance considerably. This option is not available
        for dcd and nc files as it provides no performance boost.
        
        ```
        from mdio.xtcio import xtc_open
        import numpy as np
        
        first_atoms = 56 # Imagine we are only interested in the first 56 atoms in each snapshot
        nframes = 10 # Imagine we only want the first 10 frames in the trajectory
        trajectory = np.zeros((nframes, first_atoms, 3))
        
        with xtc_open('myxtcfile.xtc') as f:
             for i in range(nframes):
        	     frame = f.read_frame(natoms=first_atoms)
        		 trajectory[i] = frame.crds
        ```
