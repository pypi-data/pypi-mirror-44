# Kommando.py
An extensible command parser for discord.py [rewrite]

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* `discord.py` library [rewrite]

## F.A.Q

#### When should i use it instead of ext.commands?
When you need to do things that ext.commands can't help you,
or you wanna make very special and user-centered commands

#### When shouldn't i use it?
When you are still learning python or when you are to uptight to try something new

#### What are the main advantages?
- Built-in keyword arguments support
- Custom methods, control of the entire command parsing
- Extensions, modular and total customization of your Bot, with
partial reloads and custom states at runtime
- Live Objects, inteligent use of callbacks
- Long-lived (or even permanent) paginators
- Multiple tasks for client events
- Easy translations and customized behaviours
- Brand-new features

#### When you will release some documentation?
Soon!

#### Soo why the custom Oni ordered an HellBox?
For Hellpy someone

#### Why this is still here? I mean, the bots aren't called onis anymore, the hellboxes are now contexts, and the project was never called Hellpy
