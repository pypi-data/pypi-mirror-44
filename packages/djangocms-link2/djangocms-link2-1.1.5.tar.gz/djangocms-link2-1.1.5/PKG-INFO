        djangocms-link2
        ===============
        
        A link/-structure management plugin that replaces the plugin shipped with django-cms with a robust version that employs file fields from django-filer.
        It can be used as a drop-in replacement for **cmsplugin_filer_link**. The package contains a management command to migrate
        all existing Link-instances from cmsplugin_filer_link to **link2**.

        Features
        ********
        
        cmsplugin_filer_link is already a great plugin and link2 builds on it. The following advantages are available in this package:
        
        * robust django-cms link plugin which doesn't fail loudly
        * persists the internal url as well
        * can be copied safely between languages (even if the target page is not yet available in this language)
        * internal and external links are monitored (through a management command)
        * faulty links are visually highlighted for the content editor
        * an admin page lists all faulty links
        * easy migration from **cmsplugin_filer_link** (through a management command)

        - install it with ``pip``::
        
            $ pip install djangocms-link2
        
        
        - add the plugins to ``INSTALLED_APPS``::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'cmsplugin_filer_link2',
                ...
            )
        
        
        - run ``migrate cmsplugin_filer_link2``.
        - remove the default ``djangocms-link`` or ``cmsplugin_filer_link`` from your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
        - add ``LINK_DOMAIN = 'www.yourdomain.com'`` to your settings to make sure files and relative paths can be checked
          through the management command.
        
        Management Command
        ==================
        
        ``./manage.py check_links`` allows you to check all ``Link`` instances.
        ``./manage.py check_links --timeout=20`` allows you to set a timeout for quicker checks. Default timeout is 60 seconds.
