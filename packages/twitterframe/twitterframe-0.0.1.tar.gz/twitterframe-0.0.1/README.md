# twitterframe
🥚🔜🐦 twiterframe. A basic command line application used in tandem with Twitter API to frame anything from Twitter into a Pandas DataFrame, or exported as a CSV.

# Progress so far...

✅ Users are able to create .json files to store their API keys.

✅ Cleaned up all the scripts and added click functionality.

✅ Functional Command Line Application by invoking ```twitterframe```

✅ Added a command that removes your Twitter API credentials file from your home directory.

✅ Scrape command is now functioning as it should be.

🔜 Open up project on pypi.org so it can be 'pip-install-able'

🔜 Make some basic documentation on installation/usage.

# Ideas on new features and commands

💡 Command that dumps tweets into a SQL database.

💡 Add more emojis.

💡 Add click.progress_bar(s) on commands like scrape and crawl to show progress.

💡 Remove some of the comments because the code looks kinda ugly.

# Known issues

❗️Crawl command is not pulling tweets by the specified times.

❗️Crawl gets a Twitter error response: status code = 429 due to the application's rate limit on the amount of requests to be served.
