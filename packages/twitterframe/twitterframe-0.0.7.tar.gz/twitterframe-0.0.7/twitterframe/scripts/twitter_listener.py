'''
	Was going to add this to the twitter_methods.py but this will just be cleaner.
	Might make it more efficient...
	From what I know about this StreamListener class is that it is required that
	create a subclass that inherits the methods from tweepy.StreamListener.
	The source code for StreamListener can be found here:
	https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy/blob/master/tweepy/streaming.py#L31
	From there we make our actual methods that route to our commands with
	the class Stream() that has a ton of stuff in the init...
