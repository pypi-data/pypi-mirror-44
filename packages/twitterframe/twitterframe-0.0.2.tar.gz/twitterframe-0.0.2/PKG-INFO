Description: # twitterframe
        
        🥚🔜🐦 twiterframe. A basic command line application used in tandem with Twitter API to frame content from Twitter as a CSV.
        
        In the future, I want to add more flexibility with the preferred output. (i.e. JSON, SQL databases, etc.)
        
        # Progress so far...
        
        ✅ Users are able to create .json files to store their API keys.
        
        ✅ Cleaned up all the scripts and added click functionality.
        
        ✅ Functional Command Line Application by invoking ```twitterframe```
        
        ✅ Added a command that removes your Twitter API credentials file from your home directory.
        
        ✅ Scrape command is now functioning as it should be.
        
        ✅ Opened up project on pypi.org so it can be 'pip-install-able' [here](https://pypi.org/project/twitterframe/)
        
        🔜 Make some basic documentation on installation/usage.
        
        # Ideas on new features and commands
        
        💡 Command that dumps tweets into a SQL database.
        
        💡 Add more emojis.
        
        💡 Add click.progress_bar(s) on commands like scrape and crawl to show progress.
        
        💡 Remove some of the comments because the code looks kinda ugly.
        
        # Known issues
        
        ❗️Crawl command is not pulling tweets by the specified times.
        
        ❗️Crawl gets a Twitter error response: status code = 429 due to the application's rate limit on the amount of requests to be served.
