# Fortuna: Random Value Generator
Fortuna's main goal is to provide a quick and easy way to build custom random generators that don't suck.

The core functionality of Fortuna is based on the RNG Storm engine. While Storm is a high quality random engine, Fortuna is not appropriate for cryptography of any kind. Fortuna is meant for games, data science, A.I. and experimental programming, not security.

Suggested Installation: `$ pip install Fortuna`

Installation on platforms other than MacOS may require building from source files.

## Random Value Classes
### TruffleShuffle
`TruffleShuffle(list_of_values: Sequence) -> callable`
- The input Sequence can be any list like object (list, set, tuple or generator).
- The input Sequence must not be empty. Values can be any python object.
- The returned callable produces a random value from the list with a wide uniform distribution.

#### TruffleShuffle, Basic Use Case
```python
from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle


list_of_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

truffle_shuffle = TruffleShuffle(list_of_values)

print(truffle_shuffle())  # prints a random value from the list_of_values.
```

**Wide Uniform Sequence**: *"Wide"* refers to the average distance between consecutive occurrences of the same item in the output sequence. The goal of this type of distribution is to keep the output sequence free of clumps while maintaining randomness and the uniform probability of each value.

This is not the same as a *flat uniform distribution*. The two distributions will be statistically similar, but the output sequences are very different. For a more general solution that offers several statistical distributions, please refer to QuantumMonty. For a more custom solution featuring discrete rarity refer to RelativeWeightedChoice and its counterpart CumulativeWeightedChoice.

**Micro-shuffle**: This is the hallmark of TruffleShuffle and how it creates a wide uniform distribution efficiently. While adjacent duplicates are forbidden, nearly consecutive occurrences of the same item are also required to be extremely rare with respect to the size of the set. This gives rise to output sequences that seem less mechanical than other random sequences. Somehow more and less random at the same time, almost human-like?

**Automatic Flattening**: TruffleShuffle and all higher-order Fortuna classes will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set at call time. Automatic flattening is dynamic, lazy, fault tolerant and on by default. Un-callable objects or those that require arguments will be returned in an uncalled state without error. A callable object can be any class, function, method or lambda. Mixing callable objects with un-callable objects is fully supported. Nested callable objects are fully supported. It's lambda all the way down.

To disable automatic flattening, pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation.

Please review the code examples of each section. If higher-order functions and lambdas make your head spin, concentrate only on the first example of each section. Because `lambda(lambda) -> lambda` fixes everything for arbitrary values of 'because', 'fixes' and 'everything'.


#### Flattening
```python
from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle


flatted = TruffleShuffle([lambda: 1, lambda: 2])
print(flatted())  # will print the value 1 or 2

un_flat = TruffleShuffle([lambda: 1, lambda: 2], flat=False)
print(un_flat()())  # will print the value 1 or 2, mind the double-double parenthesis

auto_un_flat = TruffleShuffle([lambda x: x, lambda x: x + 1])
# flat=False is not required here because the lambdas can't be called without input x satisfied.
print(auto_un_flat()(1))  # will print the value 1 or 2, mind the double-double parenthesis

```


#### Mixing Static Objects with Callable Objects
```python
from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle


mixed_flat = TruffleShuffle([1, lambda: 2])
print(mixed_flat())  # will print 1 or 2

mixed_un_flat = TruffleShuffle([1, lambda: 2], flat=False) # not recommended.
print(mixed_flat())  # will print 1 or <lambda at some_address>
# This pattern is not recommended because you wont know the nature of what you get back.
# This is almost always not what you want, and always messy.
```


##### Dynamic Strings
To successfully express a dynamic string, at least one level of indirection is required.
Without an indirection the f-string would collapse into a static string too soon.

WARNING: The following example features a higher order function that takes a tuple of lambdas and returns a higher order function that returns a random lambda that returns a dynamic f-string.

```python
from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle, d


# d is a simple dice function.
brainiac = TruffleShuffle((
    lambda: f"A{d(2)}",
    lambda: f"B{d(4)}",
    lambda: f"C{d(6)}",
))

print(brainiac())  # prints a random dynamic string.
```


### QuantumMonty
`QuantumMonty(some_list: Sequence) -> callable`
- The input Sequence can be any list like object (list, set, tuple or generator).
- The input Sequence must not be empty. Values can be any python object.
- The returned callable will produce random values from the list using the selected distribution model or "monty".
- The default monty is the Quantum Monty Algorithm.

```python
from Fortuna import QuantumMonty


list_of_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
quantum_monty = QuantumMonty(list_of_values)

print(quantum_monty())          # prints a random value from the list_of_values.
                                # uses the default Quantum Monty Algorithm.

print(quantum_monty.uniform())  # prints a random value from the list_of_values.
                                # uses the "uniform" monty: a flat uniform distribution.
                                # equivalent to random.choice(list_of_values) but better.
```
The QuantumMonty class represents a diverse collection of strategies for producing random values from a sequence where the output distribution is based on the method you choose. Generally speaking, each value in the sequence will have a probability that is based on its position in the sequence. For example: the "front" monty produces random values where the beginning of the sequence is geometrically more common than the back. Given enough samples the "front" monty will always converge to a 45 degree slope down for any list of unique values.

There are three primary method families: geometric, gaussian, and poisson. Each family has three base methods; 'front', 'middle', 'back', plus a 'quantum' method that incorporates all three base methods. The quantum algorithms for each family produce distributions by overlapping the probability waves of the other methods in their family. The Quantum Monty Algorithm incorporates all nine base methods.

In addition to the thirteen positional methods that are core to QuantumMonty, it also implements a uniform distribution as a simple base case.

**Automatic Flattening**: All higher-order Fortuna classes will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set at call time. Automatic flattening is dynamic, lazy, fault tolerant and on by default. Un-callable objects or those that require arguments will be returned in an uncalled state without error.

```python
import Fortuna


quantum_monty = Fortuna.QuantumMonty(
    ["Alpha", "Beta", "Delta", "Eta", "Gamma", "Kappa", "Zeta"]
)

""" Each of the following methods will return a random value from the sequence.
Each method has its own unique distribution model for the same data set. """

""" Flat Base Case """
quantum_monty.uniform()             # Flat Uniform Distribution

""" Geometric Positional """
quantum_monty.front()               # Geometric Descending, Triangle
quantum_monty.middle()              # Geometric Median Peak, Equilateral Triangle
quantum_monty.back()                # Geometric Ascending, Triangle
quantum_monty.quantum()             # Geometric Overlay, Saw Tooth

""" Gaussian Positional """
quantum_monty.front_gauss()         # Exponential Gamma
quantum_monty.middle_gauss()        # Scaled Gaussian
quantum_monty.back_gauss()          # Reversed Gamma
quantum_monty.quantum_gauss()       # Gaussian Overlay

""" Poisson Positional """
quantum_monty.front_poisson()       # 1/3 Mean Poisson
quantum_monty.middle_poisson()      # 1/2 Mean Poisson
quantum_monty.back_poisson()        # 2/3 Mean Poisson
quantum_monty.quantum_poisson()     # Poisson Overlay

""" Quantum Monty Algorithm """

```

### Weighted Choice: Custom Rarity
Weighted Choice offers two strategies for selecting random values from a sequence where programmable rarity is desired. Both produce a custom distribution of values based on the weights of the values.

Flatten: Both will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set. Callable objects that require arguments are returned in an uncalled state. To disable this behavior pass the optional argument flat=False during instantiation. By default flat=True.

- Constructor takes a copy of a sequence of weighted value pairs... `[(weight, value), ... ]`
- Automatically optimizes the sequence for correctness and optimal call performance for large data sets.
- The sequence must not be empty, and each pair must contain a weight and a value.
- Weights must be positive integers.
- Values can be any Python object that can be passed around... string, int, list, function etc.
- Performance scales by some fraction of the length of the sequence.

**Automatic Flattening**: All higher-order Fortuna classes will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set at call time. Automatic flattening is dynamic, lazy, fault tolerant and on by default. Un-callable objects or those that require arguments will be returned in an uncalled state without error.

The following examples produce equivalent distributions with comparable performance.
The choice to use one strategy over the other is purely about which one suits you or your data best. Relative weights are easier to understand at a glance. However, many RPG Treasure Tables map rather nicely to a cumulative weighted strategy.

#### Cumulative Weight Strategy
`CumulativeWeightedChoice(weighted_table: Table) -> callable`

_Note: Logic dictates Cumulative Weights must be unique!_

```python
from Fortuna import CumulativeWeightedChoice


cum_weighted_choice = CumulativeWeightedChoice([
    (7, "Apple"),
    (11, "Banana"),
    (13, "Cherry"),
    (23, "Grape"),
    (26, "Lime"),
    (30, "Orange"),  # same as rel weight 4 because 30 - 26 = 4
])

print(cum_weighted_choice())  # prints a weighted random value
```

#### Relative Weight Strategy
`RelativeWeightedChoice(weighted_table: Table) -> callable`

```python
from Fortuna import RelativeWeightedChoice


population = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Grape", "Lime", "Orange"]
rel_weights = [7, 4, 2, 10, 3, 4]  # Alternate zip setup.
rel_weighted_choice = RelativeWeightedChoice(zip(rel_weights, population))

print(rel_weighted_choice())  # prints a weighted random value
```

### FlexCat
`FlexCat(dict_of_lists: Matrix) -> callable`

FlexCat is a 2d QuantumMonty.

Rather than taking a sequence, FlexCat takes a Matrix: a dictionary of sequences. When the the instance is called it returns a random value from a random sequence.

The constructor takes two optional keyword arguments to specify the algorithms to be used to make random selections. The algorithm specified for selecting a key need not be the same as the one for selecting values. An optional key may be provided at call time to bypass the random key selection and select a random value from that category. Keys passed in this way must match a key in the Matrix.

By default, FlexCat will use key_bias="front" and val_bias="truffle_shuffle", this will make the top of the data structure geometrically more common than the bottom and it will truffle shuffle the sequence values. This config is known as Top Cat, it produces a descending-step distribution. Many other combinations are available.

**Automatic Flattening**: All higher-order Fortuna classes will recursively unpack callable objects returned from the data set at call time. Automatic flattening is dynamic, lazy, fault tolerant and on by default. Un-callable objects or those that require arguments will be returned in an uncalled state without error.
