Description: # fix-winpath
        If you are sure python is installed on your windows machine, but still encounter the following problem while trying to run `python` from your windows `cmd` terminal:
        
        ```
        C:\Users\Joe> python
        'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
        operable program or batch file.
        
        C:\Users\Joe> pip install requests
        'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
        operable program or batch file.
        
        C:\Users\Joe> jupyter notebook
        'jupyter' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
        operable program or batch file.
        ```
        `fix-winpath` might help you to fix your windows' PATH environment variable.
        
        ## Instructions
        Check if you can launch python using the `py` launcher first:
        
        ```
        C:\Users\Guest>py --version
        Python 3.7.0
        ```
        
        Assuming the line above works, install `fix-winpath` with: 
        
            py -3 -m pip install --upgrade fix-winpath 
            
        After installing the package successfully fix your `PATH` with:
        
            py -3 -m fix_winpath -i
