def branch_and_bound(problem, graph=True, depth_limit=float('inf')):
    """
    An exhaustive optimization technique that is guranteed to give the best
    solution. In general the algorithm starts with some (potentially
    non-optimal) solution. Then it uses the cost of the current best solution
    to prune branches of the search that do not have any chance of being better
    than this solution (i.e., that have a node_value > current best cost).

    In this implementation, node_value should provide an admissible lower bound
    on the cost of solutions reachable from the provided node. If node_value is
    inadmissible, then optimality guarantees are lost.

    Also, if the search space is infinite and/or the node_value function
    provides too little guidance (e.g., node_value = float('-inf')), then
    the search might never terminate. To counter this, a depth_limit can be
    provided that stops expanding nodes after the provided depth. This will
    ensure the search is finite and guaranteed to terminate.

    Finally, the problem.goal_test function can be used to terminate search
    early if a good enough solution has been found. If goal_test(node) return
    True, then search is immediately terminated and the node is returned.

    Note, the current implementation uses best-first search via a priority
    queue data structure.
