# guizero

[Version 0.6.2](http://lawsie.github.io/guizero/changelog) (5th Apr 2019)

guizero is designed to allow children to quickly and easily create GUIs for their programs.

If you can download and unzip a file, you can [install guizero](#easy-installation) - **no special permissions or administrator rights are required**.

If you have administrator rights and are connected to the internet, you can use [pip to quickly install guizero](#install-using-pip).

guizero only requires `tkinter` to be installed, which is included with a standard Python installation on all platforms except Linux.

## Easy installation

Use this installation method if you do not have access to a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

1. Click the green "Clone or download" button and then "Download ZIP"

## Mission statement
The aim of guizero is to make the process of creating simple GUIs quick, accessible and understandable for children.

## Aims
* Works with standard Python GUI library (and no need to install other libraries)
* Abstracts away details children find hard (such as Tkinter StringVar() objects)
* Accessible widget naming system to help children to build up a mental model
* Flexible enough to be used for projects up to A-Level standard, yet accessible to primary school children
* Comprehensive and accessible [documentation with examples](https://lawsie.github.io/guizero)
* Helpful error messages
