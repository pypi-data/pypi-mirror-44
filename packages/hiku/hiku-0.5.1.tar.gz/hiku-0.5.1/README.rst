predictable, flexible, easy to compose and because of that, they are easy
to reuse.

Highlights

* Not coupled to one specific query language
* Flexibility in result serialization, including binary format
* All concurrency models supported: async/await, threads, greenlets
* Parallel execution of the query itself for free
* No data under-fetching or over-fetching
* No extra data loading from databases, only what was needed to fulfill
  the query
* No ``N+1`` problems, they are eliminated by design
* Even complex queries of any size are predictable in terms of
  performance impact
* Implements a concept of the `Two-Level Graph` in order to put your
  business-logic in the right place
