        Flesch Kincaid readability score for text
        
        A Python module implementation of the Flesch Kincaid readability score algorithm.
        
        The source code is released under the MIT License.
        
        ### Installation ###
            pip3 install fkscore
        
        ### Usage ###
        For text in python represented as a string.
        
        Takes text as string datatype.  Words can be on same or different lines.  Current version is English language only.  Email for support.
        
            import fkscore
            text = '...blah blah blah...'
            f = fkscore.fkscore(text)
            print(f.stats)
            print(f.score)
        
            OR
        
            from fkscore import fkscore
            text = '...blah blah blah...'
            f = fkscore(text)
            print(f.stats)
            print(f.score)
        
        ### Output ###
        Output includes 2 dictionaries of information as follows:
        * stats:
          * stats['num_words']
          * stats['num_syllables']
          * stats['num_sentences']
        * score:
          * score['readability']  # Calculated F-K Readability Score
          * score['grade']        # Permuted F-K Grade Reading Level
        
        ### Releases ###
        Releases and additions will push to PyPi periodically, but if there is a feature in master not built/pushed and you want it to be, just ping me.
        
        ### History ###
        This is a maintained as an implementation of the Flesch-Kincaid readability algorithm which was initially developed in 1948 by Rudolph Flesch and later revised by the U.S. Navy in 1975.  This module is pure python and works with 3.5+.
