Python 3 interface to encode and decode GRIB and BUFR files via the
`ECMWF ecCodes library <https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/ECC/>`_.

Features with development status **Pre-alpha**:

- reads and writes GRIB 1 and 2 files,
- reads and writes BUFR 3 and 4 files,
- supports all modern versions of Python 3.7, 3.6, 3.5 and PyPy3,
- works on most *Linux* distributions and *MacOS*, the *ecCodes* C-library is the only system dependency,
- PyPI package with no install time build (binds with *CFFI* ABI mode),
- supports writing the index of a GRIB file to disk, to save a full-file scan on open.

Limitations:

- *PyPI* binary packages do not include *ecCodes*,
- incomplete documentation, for now,
- no Windows support, for now.


Installation
============

The package is installed from PyPI with::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/ecmwf/eccodes-python


System dependencies
-------------------

The Python module depends on the ECMWF *ecCodes* library
that must be installed on the system and accessible as a shared library.
Some Linux distributions ship a binary version that may be installed with the standard package manager.
On Ubuntu 18.04 use the command::

    $ sudo apt-get install libeccodes0

On a MacOS with HomeBrew use::

    $ brew install eccodes

Or if you manage binary packages with *Conda* use::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge eccodes

As an alternative you may install the official source distribution
by following the instructions at
https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/ECC/ecCodes+installation

Note that *ecCodes* support for the Windows operating system is experimental.

You may run a simple selfcheck command to ensure that your system is set up correctly::

    $ python -m eccodes selfcheck
    Found: ecCodes v2.7.0.
    Your system is ready.


Usage
=====

First, you need a well-formed GRIB file, if you don't have one at hand you can download our
`ERA5 on pressure levels sample <http://download.ecmwf.int/test-data/cfgrib/era5-levels-members.grib>`_::

    $ wget http://download.ecmwf.int/test-data/cfgrib/era5-levels-members.grib


Lower level APIs
----------------

Lower level APIs are not stable and should not be considered public yet.
In particular the internal Python 3 *ecCodes* bindings are not compatible with
the standard *ecCodes* python module.


GRIB index file
---------------

By default *eccodes-python* saves the index of the GRIB file to disk appending ``.idx``
to the GRIB file name.
Index files are an **experimental** and completely optional feature, feel free to
remove them and try again in case of problems. Index files saving can be disable passing
adding ``indexpath=''`` to the keyword argument.
