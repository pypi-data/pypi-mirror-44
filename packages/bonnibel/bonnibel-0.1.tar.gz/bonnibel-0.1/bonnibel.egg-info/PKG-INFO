Description: # Bonnibel
        
        Bonnibel (`pb` for short) builds [Ninja][] build files for a set of modules.
        Bonnibel is a thin wrapper around [Jinja][] templates defining both _modules_
        to be built and the _targets_ to build them for. This allows expressive power
        in using Ninja's simple but otherwise very powerful build definition language.
        
        For example, Bonnibel was created for [Popcorn][], where I needed the ability
        to build tools for my local native environment, use those tools to make output
        files used by other build stages, and build the bootloader, kernel and
        user-space applications all with different compiler and linker options.
        Complicating things even more, several libraries need to be built and used by
        applications on multiple target environments.
