=======================
Base Maintenance Config
=======================

This module doesn't introduce new functionalities; it rather provides maintenance-related generic tools to be used in further specific-purpose modules.
Such generic tools include:

#. A general settings section for the maintenance functionalities.
#. A security group category 'Maintenance' with two levels: 'User' and 'Manager'.

Usage
=====

This module doesn't provide new functionalities.
Still you can now set a new security group on users. To do so, you need to:

#. Go on 'Settings' -> 'Users' -> 'Users'
#. Create a new user or select an already existing one
#. In the tab 'Access Rights', at the 'Application' paragraph you'll now be able to select a group, including 'User' and 'Manager' for the 'Maintenance' category
