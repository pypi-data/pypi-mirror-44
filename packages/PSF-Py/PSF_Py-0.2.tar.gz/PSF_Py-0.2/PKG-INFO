        Description: Pattern Sequence Based Forecasting (PSF) takes univariate
            time series data as input and assist to forecast its future values.
            This algorithm forecasts the behavior of time series
            based on similarity of pattern sequences. Initially, clustering is done with the
            labeling of samples from database. The labels associated with samples are then
            used for forecasting the future behaviour of time series data.
