Description: 
        Datapoint for Python
        --------------------
        
        *A Python module for accessing weather data via the Met
        Office's open data API known as
        `Datapoint`.*
        
        **Disclaimer: This module is in no way part of the datapoint
        project/service. This module is intended to simplify the use of
        Datapoint for small Python projects (e.g school projects). No support
        for this module is provided by the Met Office and may break as the
        Datapoint service grows/evolves. The author will make reasonable efforts
        to keep it up to date and fully featured.**
        
        Changelog
        ---------
        
        + Retry the connection to datapoint if it fails (up to 10 times).
        + Use versioneer to set version number from git tag.
        + Fix failure to return forecast at midnight.
        + Add changelog.
