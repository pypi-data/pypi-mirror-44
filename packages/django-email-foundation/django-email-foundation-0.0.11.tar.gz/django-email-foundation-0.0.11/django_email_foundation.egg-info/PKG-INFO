        Description
        ===========
        
        This is a Django package that helps you build email templates for your email engine sender (we recommend you use `django-yubin`_).
        It uses the `zurb foundation for emails`_ templates and *node* packages such as *inky* or *panini*.
        
        .. _django-yubin: https://github.com/APSL/django-yubin
        .. _zurb foundation for emails: https://foundation.zurb.com/emails/docs/
        
        It provides you with some commands and functionality to integrate *zurb foundation for emails* in your django project.
        
        * *install_requires*: A command to install the required node packages, such as *inky*, *panini*, *gulp*, etc in your project.
        * *create_basic_structure*: It creates an essential tree structure in your project, that contains the basic layout and folders
          such as *pages*, *helpers* and *partials*, used by panini_.
        * *email_builder*: Starts a *gulp* process that watches your source templates, builds them and finally copies them to your target email folder. It compiles  the sources using panini_ and inky_ for the best compatibility with the major email's client.
        
        It also gives you a django view to preview the generated templates. For the preview, you can use a custom fixed context for each template, and this is very useful because it allows designers to edit the layouts.
