===========================
Stock Inventory Discrepancy
===========================

Adds the capability to show the discrepancy of every line in an inventory and
to block the inventory validation (setting it as 'Pending to Approve') when the
discrepancy is greater than an user defined threshold.

Only new group "Validate All inventory Adjustments" will be able to force the
validation of those blocked inventories. By default, Stock manager will belong
to this group. In addition, Stock Users can validate inventories under the
threshold now.


Configuration
=============

You can configure the threshold as described below:

#. Go to "Inventory > Warehouse Management" > Warehouses" or to "Inventory >
   Warehouse Management" > Locations".
#. Modify the "Maximum Discrepancy Rate Threshold" either in a Warehouse or
   in a location. If set to 0.0 in both the threshold is disabled.

Usage
=====

If you configured a "Maximum Discrepancy Rate Threshold".

* When validating an Inventory Adjustment if some line exceed the Discrepancy
  Threshold the system will set the inventory's state to 'Pending to Approve'
  and show the quantity of lines that exceed the threshold.
* If both WH and location thresholds are configured, the location one has
  preference.
* The user with "Validate All inventory Adjustments" rights can force the
  validation of an inventory pending to approve.
