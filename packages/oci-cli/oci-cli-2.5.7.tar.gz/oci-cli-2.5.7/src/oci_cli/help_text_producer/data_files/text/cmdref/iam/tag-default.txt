tag-default
***********


Description
===========

A document that specifies a default value for a Tag Definition for all
resource types created in a Compartment.

Tag Defaults are inherited by child compartments. This means that if
you set a Tag Default on the root Compartment for a tenancy, all
resources are guaranteed to be created with the referenced Tag
Definition applied.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator.
