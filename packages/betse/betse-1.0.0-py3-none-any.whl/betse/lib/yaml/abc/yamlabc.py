class YamlFileABC(YamlABC):

    wrapping a low-level mapping or sequence of YAML-backed configuration
    settings both loadable from and savable back to a YAML-formatted file)
    subclasses.

    Caveats
    ----------
    The ``conf_filename`` parameter accepted by most methods of this class
    (e.g., :meth:`load`, :meth:`write`) should be suffixed by a valid YAML
    filetype -- namely, either ``.yml`` or ``.yaml``. This class does *not*
    erforce this recommendation but does log non-fatal warnings where violated.

    External callers should *never* access the low-level :meth:`conf` property,
    as doing so violates type safety and value constraints. The configuration
    settings persisted by this property are safely retrievable and modifiable
    *only* via :func:`yaml_alias` data descriptors defined by subclasses.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _conf_basename : StrOrNoneTypes
        Basename of :attr:`_conf_filename` if non-``None`` *or* ``None``
        otherwise.
    _conf_dirname : StrOrNoneTypes

        ``None`` otherwise.
    _conf_filename : StrOrNoneTypes
        Absolute filename of the low-level YAML-formatted configuration file
        from which this object was most recently deserialized if any *or*
        ``None`` otherwise.

        Deserialize the passed YAML-formatted file into a low-level mapping or

        Usage
        ----------
        This method may be safely called multiple times with different files.
        When doing so, note that the current call to this method takes absolute
        precedence over all prior calls to this method -- which the former
        effectively nullifies. For safety, this method internally calls the
        :meth:`unload` method as needed (i.e., if some file has already been
        loaded). Ergo, that method need *not* be externally called to
        deassociate this wrapper from previously loaded files.

        Parameters
        ----------
        conf_filename : str
            Absolute or relative filename of the source file to be
            deserialized.
