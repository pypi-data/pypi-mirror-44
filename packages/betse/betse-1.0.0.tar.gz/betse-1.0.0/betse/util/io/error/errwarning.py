def ignoring_warnings(warning_class: ClassType = Warning) -> GeneratorType:
    '''
    Single-shot context manager temporarily ignoring all warnings of the passed
    type emitted by the :mod:`warnings` module for the duration of this context.

    Caveats
    -----------
    This context manager is single-shot and hence *not* safely reusable across
    multiple ``with`` blocks. Why? Because the low-level
    :class:`warnings.catch_warnings` class to which this context manager defers
    is itself single-shot, explicitly raising exceptions on reuse. While
    lamentable, this overhead appears to be unavoidable.

    Parameters
    -----------
    warning_class : optional[ClassType]
        Base class of all warnings to be ignored by this context manager.
        Defaults to :class:`Warning`, the superclass of all warning
        subclasses (builtin and user-defined), in which case this context
        manager will ignore *all* warnings.

    # Isolate all side effects produced by the "warnings" module to this block.

        # Ignore all warnings emitted by this module that are instances of the
        # previously passed base class.

        # Yield control to the body of the caller's "with" block.
