class SimConfTestABC(object, metaclass=ABCMeta):
    '''
    Abstract base class of all simulation configuration context subclasses,
    each encapsulating state and metadata for a test-related simulation
    configuration.

    Simulation configuration fixtures typically return instances of this class
    as a means of communicating this context to other fixtures and tests.

    Attributes
    ----------
    conf_dirname : str
        Absolute pathname of the parent directory containing the simulation
        configuration file encapsulated by this context.
    conf_filename : str
        Absolute pathname of the simulation configuration file encapsulated by
        this context.

        Parameters
        ----------
        conf_filename : str
            Absolute pathname of the simulation configuration file encapsulated
            by this context. Although this file need *not* physically exist
            before this object is instantiated (i.e., before this method is
            called), the subclass should ensure this file exists once this
            object is instantiated (i.e., immediately before the subclass
            implementation of this method returns).

        Context manager changing the current working directory (CWD) of the
        current test to the directory containing this configuration file for
        the duration of this context.

        Default simulation configuration paths are relative to the directory
        containing the simulation configuration file: namely, this temporary
        directory. Changing directories resolves these paths to this directory.
        (Failing to do so would incorrectly resolve these paths to the current
        directory, with predictably disastrous outcomes.) While this class
        could instead globally search-and-replace all relative simulation
        configuration paths with absolute paths, doing so would be considerably
        more complex, fragile, and error-prone than simply changing
        directories.

class SimConfTestInternal(SimConfTestABC):
    '''
    Simulation configuration context subclass encapsulating a temporary
    simulation configuration file internally isolated to the current test.

    Since this configuration is guaranteed to be test-specific and hence safely
    modifiable, caller fixtures and tests are advised to modify the contents of
    this configuration (e.g., to exercise specific feature sets and edge
    cases).

    Attributes
    ----------
    config : SimConfigWrapper
        Simulation configuration wrapper wrapping the low-level dictionary
        deserialized from the YAML-formatted simulation configuration file with
        path :attr:`conf_filepath`. Note the contents of this dictionary may
        be desynchronized from those of this file. For efficiency, callers may
        modify this dictionary to suite test requirements *before*
        reserializing this dictionary back to this file.

    Attributes (Path)
    ----------
    conf_filepath : LocalPath
        Absolute path of a temporary simulation configuration file specific to
        the parent fixture as a :class:`py.path.local` instance, defining an
        object-oriented superset of the non-object-oriented :mod:`os.path`
        module.

    See Also
    ----------

        Official :mod:`py.path` submodule documentation.

    # ..................{ INITIALIZERS                      }..................
    @type_check
    def __init__(self, conf_filepath: LocalPath) -> None:
        '''
        Initialize this simulation configuration context.

        This method (in order):

        #. Copies BETSE's default simulation configuration file, complete with
           all external assets (e.g., geometry masks) referenced and required
           by this file, to the passed path.
        #. Sanitizes the copied simulation configuration file for all child
           fixtures and tests by unconditionally disabling options either
           requiring interactive input *or* displaying interactive output.

        This method does *not* minimize the space and time costs of running
        simulations configured by this configuration. Doing so is typically
        desirable but can obscure edge-case issues, including computational
        instability produced by the default non-minified time steps.

        Caveats
        ----------
        For efficiency, note that the configuration changes applied by this
        method (listed above) reside *only* in-memory; they have yet to be
        written back to disk. Callers are required to do so manually (e.g., the
        ``is_overwriting_config`` parameter passed to the
        :meth:`CLISimTester.run_subcommands` method).

        Parameters
        ----------
        conf_filepath : LocalPath
            Absolute path to which this method will copy the default simulation
            configuration file as a :class:`py.path.local` instance. If this
            file already exists, an exception is raised.
