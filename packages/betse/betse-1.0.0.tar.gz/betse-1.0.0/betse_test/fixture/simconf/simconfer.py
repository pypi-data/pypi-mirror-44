def betse_sim_conf(betse_temp_dir: LocalPath) -> SimConfTestInternal:
    '''
    Per-test fixture creating a temporary minified simulation configuration
    file and returning an object encapsulating the contents of this file.

    Configuration Modifications (On-disk)
    ----------
    This fixture copies BETSE's default simulation configuration file,
    complete with all external assets (e.g., geometry masks) referenced and
    required by this file, into a temporary directory whose basename is the
    name of the test requesting this fixture excluding the prefixing substring
    ``test_``. When requested by the ``test_cli_sim_default`` test, for
    example, this fixture creates a temporary simulation configuration file
    ``{tmpdir}/cli_sim_default/sim_config.yaml`` for the absolute path
    ``{tmpdir}`` of this test session's root temporary directory (e.g.,
    ``/tmp/pytest-0/cli_sim_default/sim_config.yaml``).

    This directory and hence simulation configuration is safely accessible
    *only* for the duration of the current test. Subsequently run tests and
    fixtures *cannot* safely reuse this configuration.

    Configuration Modifications (In-memory)
    ----------
    This fixture also transforms the in-memory instance of the
    :class:`betse.science.parameters.Parameters` class encapsulating this
    configuration as follows:

    * All configuration options either requiring interactive input *or*
      displaying interactive output are disabled (e.g., plots, animations).
    * The space and time costs associated with simulating this configuration
      are safely minimized in a manner preserving all features.

    Since this fixture does *not* write these changes back to this file, the
    parent fixture or test is expected to do so manually (e.g., by calling the
    :meth:`SimConfTestInternal.config.overwrite` method on the object returned
    by this fixture).

    Parameters
    ----------
    betse_temp_dir : LocalPath
        Object embodying a temporary directory isolated to the current test.

    Returns
    ----------
    SimConfTestInternal
        Test-specific object encapsulating a temporary simulation configuration
        file specific to the current test, including such metadata as:
        * The absolute path of this configuration's on-disk YAML file.
        * This configuration's in-memory dictionary deserialized from this
          file.

    # Absolute path of this configuration file in this temporary directory.
    sim_conf_filepath = betse_temp_dir.join('sim_config.yaml')

    # Test-specific object encapsulating this simulation configuration file.
    sim_state = SimConfTestInternal(conf_filepath=sim_conf_filepath)

    # Minimize the space and time costs associated with this configuration.
    sim_state.config.minify()

    # Return this object.
    return sim_state


# Test-scope fixture creating and returning a new object for each unique test.
@fixture
def betse_sim_conf_default(betse_temp_dir: LocalPath) -> SimConfTestInternal:
    '''
    Per-test fixture creating a temporary default simulation configuration file
    and returning an object encapsulating the contents of this file.

    Unlike the minified simulation configuration created by the
    :func:`betse_sim_conf` fixture and leveraged by most tests, the default
    simulation configuration created by this fixture and leveraged by few tests
    is unmodified (except for disabling interactive simulation features, which
    non-interactive testing unavoidably requires). Tests doing so incur a
    significant performance penalty but can expose edge-case issues obscured by
    minification, including computational instability produced by the default
    non-minified time steps.

    Parameters
    ----------
    betse_temp_dir : LocalPath
        Object embodying a temporary directory isolated to the current test.

    Returns
    ----------
    SimConfTestInternal
        Test-specific object embodying a temporary simulation configuration.

    See Also
    ----------
    :func:`betse_sim_conf`
        Further details, ignoring minification performed by this fixture.

    # Test-specific object encapsulating this simulation configuration file.

    # Return this object *WITHOUT* calling sim_state.config.minify().

@fixture
def betse_sim_conf_compat(
    betse_temp_dir: LocalPath) -> SimConfTestExternal:
    '''
    Per-test fixture creating and returning an object encapsulating a temporary
    simulation configuration file (complete with a pickled seed,
    initialization, and simulation) produced by the oldest version of this
    application for which the current version of this application guarantees
    backward compatibility.

    Caveats
    ----------
    Unlike the object returned by the comparable :func:`betse_sim_conf`
    fixture, the object returned by this fixture is *not* safely modifiable by
    the current version of this application. Doing so would invalidate the
    pickled files produced by the older version of this application, which
    would largely defeat the purpose of invoking this fixture.

    Parameters
    ----------
    betse_temp_dir : LocalPath
        Object embodying a temporary directory isolated to the current test.

    Returns
    ----------
    SimConfTestExternal
        Test-specific object encapsulating a temporary simulation configuration
        file specific to the current test, complete with pickled seed,
        initialization, and simulation files produced by the older version of
        this application.
