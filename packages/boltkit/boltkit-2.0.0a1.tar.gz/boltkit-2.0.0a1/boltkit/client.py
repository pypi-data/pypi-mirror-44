How To Build a Neo4j Driver
***************************

Welcome to the all-in-one-file guide to how to build a Neo4j driver. This file is intended to be
read from top to bottom, giving an incremental description of the pieces required to construct a
Neo4j database driver from scratch in any language. Python has been chosen as the language to
illustrate this process due to the inherent readability of Python source code as well as
Python's comprehensive standard library and the fact that minimal boilerplate is required.

Note that while this driver is complete, it is neither supported, nor intended for use in a
production environment. You can of course decide to do ignore this and do so anyway but if you do,
you're on your own!

So, let's get started.

Neo4j provides a binary protocol, called Bolt, which is what we are actually targeting here. A
Neo4j Bolt driver can be thought of as composed of three layers...

1. Data serialisation. For this, we use a custom serialisation format called PackStream. While the
   design of this format is inspired heavily by MessagePack, it is not compatible with it.
   PackStream provides a type system that is fully compatible with the Cypher type system used by
   Neo4j and also takes extension data types in a different direction to MessagePack. More on
   PackStream shortly.
2. Bolt connections. At its heart, the Bolt protocol provides a stateful request-response
   mechanism. Each request consists of a textual statement plus a map or dictionary of
   parameters; each response is comprised of a stream of content plus some summary metadata.
   Message pipelining comes for free: a Bolt server will queue requests and respond to them in
   the same order in which they were received. A Bolt client therefore has a degree of
   flexibility in how and when it sends requests and how and when it gathers the responses.
3. The Session API. Compliant drivers adhere to a standardised API design that sits atop the
   messaging layer, commonly known as the Session API. This provides a consistent vocabulary and
   pattern of usage for application developers, regardless of language. Though this is of course a
   minimum: any driver author should feel free to innovate around this and provide any amount of
   language-idiomatic extras that are appropriate or desirable.

# CHAPTER 1: PACKSTREAM SERIALISATION
# ===================================

# First stop: PackStream. Python provides a module called `struct` for coercing data to and from
# binary representations of that data. The format codes below are the ones that PackStream cares
# about and each has been given a handy name to make the code that uses it easier to follow. The
# second character in each of these codes (the letter) represents the actual data type, the first
# character (the '>' symbol) denotes that all our representations should be big-endian. This
# means that the most significant part of the value is written to the network or memory space first
# and the least significant part is written last. PackStream thinks entirely in big ends.
#
INT_8 = ">b"        # signed 8-bit integer (two's complement)
INT_16 = ">h"       # signed 16-bit integer (two's complement)
INT_32 = ">i"       # signed 32-bit integer (two's complement)
INT_64 = ">q"       # signed 64-bit integer (two's complement)
UINT_8 = ">B"       # unsigned 8-bit integer
UINT_16 = ">H"      # unsigned 16-bit integer
UINT_32 = ">I"      # unsigned 32-bit integer
FLOAT_64 = ">d"     # IEEE double-precision floating-point format


# The PackStream type system supports a set of commonly-used data types (plus null) as well as
# extension types called "structures" that can be used to represent composite values. The full list
# of types is:
#
#   - Null (absence of value)
#   - Boolean (true or false)
#   - Integer (signed 64-bit integer)
#   - Float (64-bit floating point number)
#   - String (UTF-8 encoded text data)
#   - List (ordered collection of values)
#   - Map (keyed collection of values)
#   - Structure (composite set of values with a type tag)
#
# Neither unsigned integers nor byte arrays are supported but may be added in a future version of
# the format. Note that 32-bit floating point numbers are also not supported. This is a deliberate
# decision and these won't be added in any future version.


# Oh, by the way, we use hexadecimal a lot here. If you're not familiar with that, you might want
# to take a short break and hop over to Wikipedia to read up about it before going much further...


class Structure:

    def __init__(self, tag, *fields):
        self.tag = tag
        self.fields = fields

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.tag == other.tag and self.fields == other.fields

    def __ne__(self, other):
        return not self.__eq__(other)


def packed(*values):
    """ This function provides PackStream values-to-bytes functionality, a process known as
    "packing". The tag of the method permits any number of values to be provided as
    positional arguments. Each will be serialised in order into the output byte stream.

    Markers
    -------
    Every serialised value begins with a marker byte. The marker contains information on data type
    as well as direct or indirect size information for those types that require it. How that size
    information is encoded varies by marker type.

    Some values, such as boolean true, can be encoded within a single marker byte. Many small
    integers (specifically between -16 and +127 inclusive) are also encoded within a single byte.

    A number of marker bytes are reserved for future expansion of the format itself. These bytes
    should not be used, and encountering them in an incoming stream should treated as an error.

    Sized Values
    ------------
    Some value types require variable length representations and, as such, have their size
    explicitly encoded. These values generally begin with a single marker byte, followed by a size,
    followed by the data content itself. Here, the marker denotes both type and scale and therefore
    determines the number of bytes used to represent the size of the data. The size itself is
    either an 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit unsigned integer. Sizes longer than this are not yet
    supported.

    The diagram below illustrates the general layout for a sized value, here with a 16-bit size:

      Marker Size          Content
        <>  <--->  <--------------------->
        XX  XX XX  XX XX XX XX .. .. .. XX


    Args:
        values: Series of values to pack.

    Returns:
        Byte representation of values.
    """

    # First, let's define somewhere to collect the individual byte pieces and grab a couple of
    # handles to commonly-used methods.
    #
    data = []
    append = data.append
    extend = data.extend

    # Next we'll iterate through the values in turn and add the output to our collection of byte
    # pieces.
    #
    for value in values:

        # Null is always encoded using the single marker byte C0.
        #
        if value is None:
            append(b"\xC0")

        # Integers
        # --------
        # Integer values occupy either 1, 2, 3, 5 or 9 bytes depending on magnitude. Several
        # markers are designated specifically as TINY_INT values and can therefore be used to pass
        # a small number in a single byte. These markers can be identified by a zero high-order bit
        # (for positive values) or by a high-order nibble containing only ones (for negative
        # values). The available encodings are illustrated below and each shows a valid
        # representation for the decimal value 42:
        #
        #     2A                          -- TINY_INT
        #     C8:2A                       -- INT_8

        #
        # Note that while encoding small numbers in wider formats is supported, it is generally
        # recommended to use the most compact representation possible. The following table shows
        # the optimal representation for every possible integer:

        # Structures
        # ----------
        # Structures represent composite values and consist, beyond the marker, of a single byte
        # tag followed by a sequence of fields, each an individual value. The size of a
        # structure is measured as the number of fields and not the total byte size. This count
        # does not include the tag. The markers used to denote a structure are described in
        # the table below:
        #
        #   Marker | Size                                        | Maximum size
        #  ========|=============================================|=======================
        #   B0..BF | contained within low-order nibble of marker | 15 fields
        #   DC     | 8-bit big-endian unsigned integer           | 255 fields
        #   DD     | 16-bit big-endian unsigned integer          | 65 535 fields
        #
        # The tag byte is used to identify the type or class of the structure. Tag
        # bytes may hold any value between 0 and +127. Bytes with the high bit set are reserved
        # for future expansion. For structures containing fewer than 16 fields, the marker byte
        # should contain the high-order nibble 'B' (binary 1011) followed by a low-order nibble
        # containing the size. The marker is immediately followed by the tag byte and the
        # field values.
        #
        # For structures containing 16 fields or more, the marker DC or DD should be used,
        # depending on scale. This marker is followed by the size, the tag byte and the
        # fields, serialised in order. Examples follow below:
        #
        #     B3 01 01 02 03  -- Struct(sig=0x01, fields=[1,2,3])
        #     DC 10 7F 01  02 03 04 05  06 07 08 09  00 01 02 03
        #     04 05 06  -- Struct(sig=0x7F, fields=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]

# CHAPTER 2: CONNECTIONS
# ======================
# It's here that we get properly into the protocol. A Bolt connection operates under a
# client-server model whereby a client sends requests to a server and the server responds
# accordingly. There is no mechanism for a server to send a message at any other time, nor should
# client software receive data when no message is expected.

# Connection API Compliance
# -------------------------
# To construct a compatible Connection API, the following function and classes (or their idiomatic
# equivalents) should be implemented. Further details for each of these are given in the reference
# implementations that follow below.
#
# connect(address, connection_settings) -> Connection   // Establish a connection to a Bolt server.
# ConnectionSettings(user, password, user_agent)        // Holder for connection settings.
# Connection(socket, connection_settings)               // Active connection to a Bolt server.
# Request(description, *message)                        // Client request message.
# Response()                                            // Basic response handler.
#   QueryResponse()                                     // Query response handler.
#     QueryStreamResponse()                             // Data stream response handler.
# Failure()                                             // Exception signalling request failure.
# ProtocolError()                                       // Exception signalling protocol breakdown.

# The Handshake
# -------------
# On successfully establishing a TCP connection to a listening server, the client should send a
# fixed sequence of four bytes in order to declare to the server that it intends to speak Bolt.
#
# Fun fact: the four "magic" bytes are supposed to spell "GO GO BOLT!" when written in hex and
# read through squinted eyes. Other hilarious phrases were considered and rejected.
#
BOLT = b"\x60\x60\xB0\x17"

# After the protocol announcement comes version negotiation. The client proposes to the server up
# to four protocol versions that it is able to support in order of preference. Each protocol
# version is a 32-bit unsigned integer and zeroes are used to fill the gaps if the client knows
# fewer than four versions.
#
# In response, the server replies with a single version number on which it agrees. If for some
# reason it can't agree, it returns a zero and disconnects immediately.
#
# Now that you've read and absorbed all that, push it to the back of your brain. As there currently
# exists only one version of Bolt, the negotiation turns out to be far more simple than that. The
# server and client send the following to each other:
#
#   C: 00:00:00:01 00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00
#   S: 00:00:00:01
#
# And that's it. If the server responds with anything else, hang up and get in touch. We may have a
# problem.
#

# Messaging
# ---------
# Once we've negotiated the (one and only) protocol version, we fall into the regular protocol
# exchange. This consists of request and response messages, each of which is serialised as a
# PackStream structure with a unique tag byte.
#
# The client sends messages from the selection below:
MAX_BOLT_VERSION = 4
CLIENT = [None] * (MAX_BOLT_VERSION + 1)
CLIENT[1] = {
    "INIT": 0x01,               # INIT <user_agent> <auth_token>

                                # validly be exchanged. INIT bundles with it two pieces of data:
