Description: What is PhyloPyPruner?
        ----------------------
        
        PhyloPyPruner is a Python package for refining the output of a graph-based
        orthology inference approach such as
        [OrthoMCL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12952885),
        [OrthoFinder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26243257) or
        [HaMStR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19586527). Similar to other
        tree-based orthology inference methods (e.g.,
        [PhyloTreePruner](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3825643/),
        [UPhO](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/33/8/2117/2578877),
        [Agalma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3840672/) and
        [Phylogenomic Dataset
        Reconstruction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25158799)), it
        uses phylogenetic trees in order to obtain genes that are 1:1 orthologous. In
        addition to filters and algorithms seen in pre-existing tools, this package
        provides new methods for differentiating [contamination-like
        sequences](https://gitlab.com/fethalen/phylopypruner/wikis/About-PhyloPyPruner#contamination-like-issues-)
        from paralogs.
        
        PhyloPyPruner is under active development and I would appreciate it if you try
        this software on your own data and [leave
        feedback](mailto:felix.thalen@uni-goettingen.de).

        **Figure 1.** An overview of a tree-based orthology inference approach. First,
        sequences from different species are clustered together based on an
        all-versus-all BLAST, followed by Markov clustering. Each node in the cluster
        corresponds to a sequence and each edge corresponds to a similarity score.
        Homologous groups are then aligned and a phylogenetic tree is inferred from the
        alignment. From this tree, orthologous groups can be identified and paralogs
        are pruned away.
        
        ## Quick installation
        
        The easiest way to install PhyloPyPruner is by using the package manager for
        Python, [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):
        
        ```bash
        pip install phylopypruner # install for all users
        pip install --user phylopypruner # install for the current user only
        ```
        
        Once installed, the program is located within `$HOME/.local/bin`. Depending on
        your OS, you might have to add the directory to your `$PATH` to avoid typing
        the entire path. Once in your path, you run the program like this:
        
        ```bash
        phylopypruner
        ```
