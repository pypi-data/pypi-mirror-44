.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
rtprint [options] <path1>:<port1> [<path2>:<port2>...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Print the data being sent by one or more output ports to stdout.
.sp
By default, only the first value received from one or more ports is
printed.  Options are available to print multiple values or print
regularly for a specified length of time. In any one loop of the port
checks, if only one port out of multiple has data available, that is
counted as a print for the purposes of printing a fixed number of times.
.sp
To print data which cannot be natively printed by Python, create a
formatting function to print that data. The function must receive one
argument: the data to print. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def rawpy(data):
    return data.__repr__()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A connection will be made to each port using the default connection
settings compatible with that port.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-m \ MODULES\fP,\fB \ \-\-mod\fB= MODULES

the constant\(aqs data types, try listing the modules here. The module
and its \fB__POA\fP partner will be imported.

Specify the rate in Hertz at which to read and print.
.TP
.BI \-t \ TIMEOUT\fP,\fB \ \-\-timeout\fB= TIMEOUT
Read data for this many seconds, then stop.  This option overrides
\fB\-\-number\fP\&.

.SH PATHS
.sp
\fBrtshell\fP uses \fIpaths\fP to indicate objects in the RTC Tree. A path is
the address of object. Name servers and naming contexts on name servers
are considered directories. Managers and RT\-Components are considered
\(aqfiles\(aq. As with the POSIX \fBcat\fP command, the path specified as an
argument to commands is appended to the current rtshell working
directory, which is stored in the \fBRTCSH_CWD\fP environment variable and
changeable using the \fBrtcwd\fP command.
.sp
The available paths depend on the known name servers at the time the
command is executed. This is a combination of the servers listed in the
\fBRTCSH_NAMESERVERS\fP environment variable and the servers used in given
paths.
.sp
For example, \fB/localhost/comp0.rtc\fP refers to the component named
\fBcomp0.rtc\fP registered on the name server at \fBlocalhost\fP\&.
\fB/localhost/manager/comp0.rtc\fP refers to the component \fBcomp0.rtc\fP
in the directory \fBmanager\fP on the \fBlocalhost\fP name server.
\fB\&./comp0.rtc\fP refers to that component in the current directory.
.sp
When specifying a port on an RT\-Component, it should be placed after the
path, separated by a colon. For example, \fB/localhost/comp0.rtc:data\fP
refers to the port \fBdata\fP on the component \fBcomp0.rtc\fP\&.
.sp
Some commands that create new ports accept extra options in the paths,
such as a name for the automatically generated port, or a formatter. The
format for specifying these paths is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
path:port.name#formatter
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/localhost/blurg.host_cxt/comp0.rtc:input.stuff#a_printer
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This specifies that the automatically generated port should be named
\fBstuff\fP, and the data type it handles should be printed using the
\fBa_printer\fP function (which must be available, usually it is provided
by the user in a loadable module). The port will be connected to the
\fBinput\fP port of the \fBcomp0.rtc\fP component.
.sp
The name component is optional. If it is not present, neither
should the \fB\&.\fP character be. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/localhost/blurg.host_cxt/comp0.rtc:input#a_printer
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The formatter component is optional. If it is not present, neither
should the \fB#\fP character be. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/localhost/blurg.host_cxt/comp0.rtc:input.stuff
.ft P
.fi

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B RTCTREE_ORB_ARGS
A list of arguments, separated by semi\-colons, to pass to the ORB
when creating it. Optional.
.TP
.B RTCTREE_NAMESERVERS
A list of name server addresses, separated by semi\-colons, to parse
when creating the RTCTree. Each server in the list will be added to
the tree, making it available for browsing with rtshell.  Optional.
.TP
.B RTSH_CWD
The current working directory in the tree. Do not set this variable;
it is set automatically by rtshell.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The only variable that should normally be set by the user is
\fBRTCTREE_NAMESERVERS\fP\&. Set this to a list of name server addresses,
separated by semi\-colons, that rtshell should interact with. For
example, in a Bash shell, the following command will set the known name
serves to \fBlocalhost\fP, \fB192.168.0.1:65346\fP and \fBexample.com\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ export RTCTREE_NAMESERVERS=localhost;192.168.0.1:65346;example.com
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
