Description: # txtv - A client for reading swedish text tv in the terminal
        
        Text-tv is great! plaintext and to-the-point news with no bullshit.
        Now you can read it without touching your mouse or your tv-remote :)

        ## Installation
        
        	pip install --user txtv
        
        ## Usage
        
        Running with no arguments will enter interactive mode.
        
        	txtv
        
        From there you can run any of these commands:
        
        	help | h | ? -- show this help text.
        	quit | q | exit -- quit the program (duh)
        	list | ls | l -- list all articles
        	next | n | > -- show next available page.
        	previous | prev | p | < -- show previous available page.
        	<PAGE NUMBER> -- show the page at the specified number
        
        You can also give any of these commands as an argument on the normal command line to run un-interactively. Except for `quit`, `next`, and `previous`, because that would make no sense.
        
        	txtv 100  # show page 100
        
        	txtv ls   # list all news articles
        
        ## Configuration
        
        txtv.py will automatically generate a config file at `~/.config/txtv/txtv.cfg` with default values.
        Right now the most interesting thing there is aliases which work both in CLI mode and interactive mode. You can also change what your interactive prompt looks like if you care about that.
