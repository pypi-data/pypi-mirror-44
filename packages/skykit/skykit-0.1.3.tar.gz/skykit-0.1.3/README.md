# Sky Kit

Easy to use out-of-the-box satellite imagery package for Python aficionado.

Adding **fun** to satellites coolness üòé

> Warning: This is still a work in progress. Please do not use in production, yet.

## Seriously, what is it? üßê

Sky kit is an ensemble of methods to ease satellite imagery processing, from and to developers and data scientists. Working with any satellite imagery provider, should be as easy as:

```
from skykit.providers import <ProviderName>
```

## Install üöÄ

As with any python package, **pip** is your friend:

```
pip install skykit
```

## Usage üé°

### Quick Start

The following shows details of a tile from Sentinel-2, that includes Paris (France), from 01/03/2019 to 08/03/2019:

```python
from datetime import date
from skykit.providers import Sentinel2

sat = Sentinel2(username="xxx", password="yyy")

tiles = sat.query(
    coordinates=(2.349014, 48.864716),     # Paris (FR) coordinates
    dates=(date(2019,3,1), date(2019,3,8)) # From march 1, 2019 to march 8, 2019
    )

len(tiles) # returns 6

tile = tiles[0]         # Pick any tile you want, or filter more
print(tile['summary'])  # returns 'Date: 2019-03-02T10:50:29.024Z, Instrument: MSI, Mode: , Satellite: Sentinel-2, Size: 730.27 MB'
```

In the previous example, the `tiles` variable will include meta information of every tile returned from Sentinel-2 query.

## Features

### Connecting to satellite images providers

Actually, Sky kit support the following ticked providers (others coming):

- [ ] Sentinel 1
- [x] Sentinel 2
- [ ] Landsat 7
- [ ] Landsat 8
- [ ] Modis
- [ ] Cbers-4
- [ ] Aqua

All image providers are grouped into `skykit.providers` module. Invoking a provider (like Sentinel-2) can be done like this:

```python
from skykit.providers import Sentinel2
```

We then need to initialize the connection with the provider. eg with Sentinel-2:

```python
sat = Sentinel2(username="xxx", password="yyy")
```

> Nota: Sentinel 1 & 2 require having credentials to connect to [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/). Once created, insert your credentials in the code above.

## Todo üî≠

- [ ] Write a better documentation. Look for readthedocs.io
- [ ] Add providers
- [ ] Create a reusable abstraction of `Tile`, to create a uniform use of tiles, no matter which provider
- [ ] Ease working with tiles meta data (usually about the scene and satellite)
- [x] Allow querying using a polygon
- [ ] Allow querying using an address
- [ ] Use friendly dates (like text: `"26/03/2019"`), of use `from="..."` and `to="..."` instead of `date=(...)`
- [ ] Allow working on specific bands. Something like:

```python
image = tile.get('b04') # or tile.b04() ???
```

- [ ] More tests <-- ‚ö† URGENT
- [ ] Create a CI/CD pipeline to publish **tags** into PyPi

This list is not exhaustive.
