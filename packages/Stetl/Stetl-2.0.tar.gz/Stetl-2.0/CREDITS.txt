* Frank Steggink
* Thijs Brentjens
* and more, see contributors: https://github.com/geopython/stetl/graphs/contributors

Bas Couwenberg is providing Debian/Ubuntu packaging.

Rob van Loon preparing Python3 migration and other.

This project would not be possible without the great work of Frank Warmerdam and other
GDAL/OGR developers (http://gdal.org).

Plus the people that brought Python, PostGIS (Paul Ramsey et al.), Jinja2, lxml and the libs
like GEOS, Proj, libxml2 and libxslt.

We are mainly standing on the shoulders of these giants.

Thanks to Tom Kralidis for helping out to move from personal repo to https://github.com/geopython organization.
