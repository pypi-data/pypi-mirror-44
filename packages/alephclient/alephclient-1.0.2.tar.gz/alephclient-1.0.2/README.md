# alephclient

Command-line client for Aleph. It can be used to bulk import document sets via
the API, without direct access to the server. It requires an active API client
to perform uploads.

## Installation

Install using `pip`.

```bash
pip install alephclient
```

## Usage

`alephclient` needs the url of an Aleph API instance and an API key for the said
API. These can be provided by setting the environment variables `ALEPH_HOST` and
`ALEPH_API_KEY` respectively; or by passing them in with `--api-base-url` and
`--api-key` options.

### Commands

#### `crawldir`

The crawldir command crawls through a given directory recursively and uploads
all the files and directories inside it to a collection. The foreign id of the
collection needs to be passed to the command with `--foreign-id` option. The
language used in the directory can optionally be specified with the --language
option, which expects a 2-letter ISO 639 language code. It can be specified
multiple times, for when the directory contains files in more than one language.
The `path` argument needs to be a valid path to a directory

Example:

```bash
alephclient --api-base-url http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/2/ --api-key 2c0ae66024f0403bb751207e54c5eb5d crawldir --foreign-id wikileaks-cable --category leak /Users/sunu/data/cable
```

#### `bulkload`

The bulkload command executes an entity mapping in the system. Its only argument
is a YAML mapping file.
