           Pelops Overview
        
        ``Hippasos`` is part of the collection of mqtt based microservices
        `pelops <https://gitlab.com/pelops>`__. An overview on the microservice
        architecture and examples can be found at
        (http://gitlab.com/pelops/pelops).

        =========
        
        Installation Core-Functionality
        -------------------------------
        
        Prerequisites for the core functionality are:
        
        ::
        
            sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-pygame
            sudo pip3 install paho-mqtt pyyaml pygame pelops
        
        Install via pip:
        
        ::
        
            sudo pip3 install epidaurus
        
        To update to the latest version add ``--upgrade`` as prefix to the
        ``pip3`` line above.
        
        Install via gitlab (might need additional packages):
        
        ::
        
            git clone git@gitlab.com:pelops/hippasos.git
            cd hippasos
            sudo python3 setup.py install
        
        This will install the following shell scripts: \* ``hippasoss``
        
        The script cli arguments are: \* '-c'/'--config' - config file
        (mandatory) \* '-v' - verbose output (optional) \* '--version' - show
        the version number and exit
        
        YAML-Config
        -----------
        
        | A yaml [2]_ file must contain four root blocks: \* mqtt -
          mqtt-address, mqtt-port, and path to credentials file credentials-file
          (a file consisting of two entries: mqtt-user, mqtt-password) \* logger
          - which log level and which file to be used
        | \* sound-mappings - list of sound events
        
        ::
        
            mqtt:
                mqtt-address: localhost
                mqtt-port: 1883
                credentials-file: ~/credentials.yaml
                log-level: WARNING
        
            logger:
                log-level: DEBUG
                log-file: hippasos.log
        
            sound-mappings:
                - name: bell_building  # unique name for sound event
                  sound-file: ../resources/church_bell.ogg  # uri to sound file. must be ogg or wav.
                  topic-sub: /test/button1  # react to published values on this channel
                  message-value: PRESSED  # react to this message content
                  volume: 0.1  # 0..1 - volume relative to system volume
                  active: True  # entry ignored if set to False
        
        systemd
        -------
        
        -  add systemd example.
        
        For Developers
        ==============
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        The project consists of two main modules: \* ``soundservice`` - Creates,
        starts and stops sound events. \* ``soundevent`` - Subscribes to a topic
        and plays a sound file upon reception of a specific message.
        
        Todos
        -----
        
        -  Make maximum number of parallel playable sound configurable.
        -  ...
        
        Misc
        ----
        
        The code is written for ``python3`` (and tested with python 3.5 on an
        Raspberry Pi Zero with Raspbian Stretch).

        .. [1]
           The icon used for this project is not Hippasos, son of pelops but it
           depicts Hippasus of Metapontum.
        
        .. [2]
           Currently, pyyaml is yaml 1.1 compliant. In pyyaml On/Off and Yes/No
           are automatically converted to True/False. This is an unwanted
           behavior and deprecated in yaml 1.2. In copreus this autoconversion
           is removed. Thus, On/Off and Yes/No are read from the yaml file as
           strings (see module baseclasses.myconfigtools).
