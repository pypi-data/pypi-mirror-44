## acl engine global options
#[ACL]
## Enable extended matching rules (enabled by default)
## If the rule is a string like 'user1 = desk*', it will match any client that
## matches 'desk*' no mater what agent it is attached to.
## If it is a coma separated list of strings like 'user1 = desk*,laptop*' it
## will match the first matching rule no mater what agent it is attached to.
## If it is a dict like:
## user1 = '{"agents": ["srv*", "www*"], "clients": ["desk*", "laptop*"]}'
## It will also validate against the agent name.
#extended = true
## If you don't explicitly specify ro/rw grants, what should we assume?
#assume_rw = true
## Enable 'legacy' behavior
## Since v0.6.0, if you don't specify the agents name explicitly, users will be
## granted on every agents where a client matches user's ACL. If you enable the
## 'legacy' behavior, you will need to specify the agents explicitly.
## Note: enabling this option will also disable the extended mode
#legacy = false
## The inheritance order maters, it means depending the order you choose,
## the ACL engine won't handle the grants the same way.
## By default, ACL inherited by groups will have lower priority, unless you
## choose otherwise
#inverse_inheritance = false
## If you specify agents and clients separately, should we link them implicitly?
## For instance, '{"agents": ["agent1", "agent2"], "clients": ["client1", "client2"]}'
## will become: '{"agents": {"agent1": ["client1", "client2"], "agent2": ["client1", "client2"]}}'
#implicit_link = true

## basicacl specific options
## Note: in case you leave this section commented, the user 'admin' will have
## access to all clients whereas other users will only see the client that have
## the same name
#[BASIC:ACL]
## Backend priority. Higher is first
#priority = 100
## List of administrators
#admin = user1,user2
## List of moderators. Users listed here will inherit the grants of the
## 'virtual' user '@moderator'
#+moderator = user5,user6
#@moderator = '{"agents":{"ro":["agent1"]}}'
## NOTE: if you are running single-agent mode, you should specify the ro/rw
## rights of the moderators using this special 'local' agent name:
## NOTE: this is the default when running single-agent mode if you don't
## specify anything else
##@moderator = '{"agents": {"rw": "local"}}'
## Please note the double-quotes and single-quotes on the following lines are
## mandatory!
## You can also overwrite the default behavior by specifying which clients a
## user can access
## Suppose you are running single-agent mode (the default), you only need to
## specify a list of clients a user can access:
#user3 = '{"clients": {"ro": ["prod*"], "rw": ["dev*", "test1"]}}'
## In case you are not in a single mode, you can also specify which clients
## a user can access on a specific Agent
#user4 = '{"agents": {"agent1": ["client6", "client7"], "agent2": ["client8"]}}'
## You can define read-only and/or read-write grants using:
#user5 = '{"agents": {"www*": {"ro": ["desk*"], "rw": ["desk1"]}}}'
## Finally, you can define groups using the syntax "@groupname" and adding
## members using "+groupname". Note: groups can inherit groups!
#@group1 = '{"agents": {"ro": ["*"]}}'
#@group2 = '{"clients": {"rw": ["dev*"]}}'
#+group1 = @group2
#+group2 = user5
## As a result, user5 will be granted the following rights:
## '{"ro": {"agents": ["*", "agent1"], "www*": ["desk*"]}, "rw": {"clients": ["dev*"], "www*": ["desk1"]}}

## If you set single to 'false', add at least one section like this per
