# Overview

qfracture is a Qt based front end exposing a fracture project. The interface
allows for data browsing and searching as well as data interaction.

# Browsing

qFracture displays a browsing panel which allows you to navigate data in a 
natural way - which is particularly useful if your data is file based.

Right clicking a _Data Asset_ exposes the functionality bound to that data. 


# Searching

Within qFracture you can perform searches against your dataset. Fracture is 
 very quick at resolving searches - so this can be a preferable mechanism
 when interacting with data if you have a reasonable idea of what you're looking
 for. 
 
When no search entries are present this view will show any _Data Elements_ which
you have marked as being favourites - allowing them to be accessed very quickly
with no overhead. 


# Setting up a Project


The qFracture UI offers a wizard to make it easy to setup a new fracture 
project. This guides you through the process of defining the data structure 
location, the plugin locations and where you want to save your project file.

It will also initiate a short scan of your data location. Depending on how
big your data set this can take a little time. 

Upon completion your data set is entirely searchable.


## System Tray


The qFracture Ui only performs a deep scan during the first time setup. Beyond
that, each location is re-scanned as you traverse those locations through the
browser panel.

If you want time based scans to occur you can trigger the __System Tray__ 
application (which is launchable from the _Settings_ tab). The system tray
allows you to specify an interval time (in seconds), and enable or disable
timed scans. 

This approach allows the scanning to occur in a completely different process
to any qFracture instances which can aid performance, especially if you're 
running qFracture from within environments such as Maya or Max etc.
