Description: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/VidaID/pysecbytes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/VidaID/pysecbytes)
        
        ## Install:
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/VidaID/pysecbytes.git  
        
        ## Use:
        
        Currently supports clearing integers, strings and bytes
        
            from SecureBytes import clearmem, safemem
            
            x = b'data that must be removed'
        
            copy_of_x = x
        
            clearmem(x)
        
            assert(b'data' not in copy_of_x)
        
        In python3 only, temporarily overriding mem allocator to zero ram and prevent paging:
        
            with safemem():
                x = b'data that must be removed'
                del x
        
            # x is not in ram
        
            
        ## Warnings:
        
          - Do not try to derive from str or bytes... extra copies of your data will be made
          - Clearing strings and bytes also clears all references to them
          - If you choose store sensitive material in a class, and put clearmem in __del__, it will only be cleared when the last reference is freed
          - "safemem" is not yet efficient (TODO) nor does it prevent swapping (TODO)
