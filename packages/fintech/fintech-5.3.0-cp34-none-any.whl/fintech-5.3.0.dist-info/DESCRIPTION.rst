The Python FinTech package
==========================

This package contains all the functionality that is required to work with
EBICS, SEPA and other financial technologies. The usage has been realised
as simple as possible but also as flexible as necessary.

Features
--------

- Obtain bank account statements (incl. CAMT and MT940 parser)
- Create and submit SEPA credit transfers (pain.001)
- Create and submit SEPA direct debits CORE/B2B (pain.008)
- Mostly full SEPA support
- Automatic calculation of the lead time based on holidays and cut-off times
- Integrated mandate manager (beta)
- Plausibility check of IBAN and BIC
- Validation of payment orders against the SEPA Clearing Directory of the
  German Central Bank
- Bankcode/Account to IBAN converter according to the rules of the German
  Central Bank
- Currency converter
- DATEV converter (KNE)

The FinTech package provides you the possibility to manage all of your everyday
commercial banking activities such as credit transfers, direct debits or the
retrieval of bank account statements in a flexible and secure manner.

All modules can be used free of charge. Only the unlicensed version of the
EBICS module has few restrictions. The upload of SEPA documents is limited
to a maximum of five transactions and bank account statements can not be
retrieved for the last three days.

Examples
--------

Simple SEPA Credit Transfer (pain.001)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. sourcecode:: python

    import fintech
    fintech.register()
    from fintech.sepa import Account, SEPACreditTransfer

    # Create the debtor account from an IBAN
    debtor = Account('DE89370400440532013000', 'Max Mustermann')
    # Create the creditor account from a tuple (IBAN, BIC)
    creditor = Account(('AT611904300234573201', 'BKAUATWW'), 'Maria Musterfrau')
    # Create a SEPACreditTransfer instance
    sct = SEPACreditTransfer(debtor)
    # Add the transaction
    tx = sct.add_transaction(creditor, 10.00, 'Purpose')
    # Render the SEPA document
    print(sct.render())

Simple SEPA Direct Debit (pain.008)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. sourcecode:: python

    import fintech
    fintech.register()
    from fintech.sepa import Account, SEPADirectDebit

    # Create the creditor account from a tuple (ACCOUNT, BANKCODE)
    creditor = Account(('532013000', '37040044'), 'Max Mustermann')
    # Assign the creditor id
    creditor.set_creditor_id('DE98ZZZ09999999999')
    # Create the debtor account from a tuple (IBAN, BIC)
    debtor = Account(('AT611904300234573201', 'BKAUATWW'), 'Maria Musterfrau')
    # For a SEPA direct debit a valid mandate is required
    debtor.set_mandate(mref='M00123456', signed='2014-02-01', recurrent=True)
    # Create a SEPADirectDebit instance of type CORE
    sdd = SEPADirectDebit(creditor, 'CORE')
    # Add the transaction
    tx = sdd.add_transaction(debtor, 10.00, 'Purpose')
    # Render the SEPA document
    print(sdd.render())

EBICS
+++++

.. sourcecode:: python

    import fintech
    fintech.register()
    from fintech.ebics import EbicsKeyRing, EbicsBank, EbicsUser, EbicsClient

    keyring = EbicsKeyRing(keys='~/mykeys', passphrase='mysecret')
    bank = EbicsBank(keyring=keyring, hostid='MYBANK', url='https://www.mybank.de/ebics')
    user = EbicsUser(keyring=keyring, partnerid='CUSTOMER123', userid='USER1')
    # Create new keys for this user
    user.create_keys(keyversion='A006', bitlength=2048)

    client = EbicsClient(bank, user)
    # Send the public electronic signature key to the bank.
    client.INI()
    # Send the public authentication and encryption keys to the bank.
    client.HIA()

    # Create an INI-letter which must be printed and sent to the bank.
    user.create_ini_letter(bankname='MyBank AG', path='~/ini_letter.pdf')

    # After the account has been activated the public bank keys
    # must be downloaded and checked for consistency.
    print(client.HPB())

    # Finally the bank keys must be activated.
    bank.activate_keys()

    # Download MT940 bank account statements
    data = client.STA(
        start='2014-02-01',
        end='2014-02-07',
        )
    client.confirm_download()
