Description: # UiPath-Scaffold
        
        Scaffolds out UiPath projects using one of the selected Frameworks. 
        Generates project.json with project name and description. 
        Adds sequences as needed.
        
        
        To create a new generator, just create a new .py file with uipath-XXXXX-generator.py as the file name. This file must create a new instance of Generator. The GeneratorAPI in cli.py will pick it up and use it.
        
        # Usage
        * python cli.py
          * Scaffolds a new project after allowing you to choose the generator you would like.
          * *Note:* you must install a generator before this program will do anything
