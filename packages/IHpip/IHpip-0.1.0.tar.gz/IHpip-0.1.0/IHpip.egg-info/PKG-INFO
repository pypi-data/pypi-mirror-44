Description: ### IHpip
        simple extension to the pip -r command which allows you to separate your dependencies
        for different environments e.g. testing and production
        
        sample requirements.yml
        ```yaml
        test:
          - pytest
          - tox
        
        prod:
          - pyyaml
        ```
        to install the test dependencies run
        ```ihpip requirements.yml test```
        
        this can also be used to separate python dependencies for different docker containers
