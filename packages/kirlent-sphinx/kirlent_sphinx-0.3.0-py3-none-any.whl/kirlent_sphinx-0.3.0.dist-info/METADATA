Description-Content-Type: text/x-rst

kirlent_sphinx is a Sphinx extension that is primarily meant to be used with
the `Kırlent`_ educational content management system, although it can be used
as a regular Sphinx extension.

Features
--------

kirlent_sphinx provides the following components:

- An extended ``table`` directive derived from the `Cloud Sphinx Theme`_
  project.

- A ``slide`` directive and corresponding HTML themes using `RevealJS`_
  or `ImpressJS`_.

Getting started
---------------

You can install kirlent_sphinx with pip::

  pip install kirlent_sphinx

To enable it in your project, make the following changes in ``conf.py``:

- Add ``kirlent_sphinx`` to extensions::

    extensions = ["kirlent_sphinx"]

- Set the theme to use revealjs or impressjs using one of the below lines::

    html_theme = "kirlent_revealjs"
    html_theme = "kirlent_impressjs"

- Disable index generation::

    html_use_index = False

Usage
-----

For the extended ``table`` directive, consult the documentation
of the `table_styling`_ extension of the `Cloud Sphinx Theme`_ project.

The ``slide`` directives can support most of the ``data-`` attributes
as described in the documentations of the `RevealJS`_ and `ImpressJS`_
projects.

The themes include `Tailwind`_ utility classes for styling::

  .. slide:: Slide title

     .. container:: columns

        .. container:: column w-1/3 bg-blue-lighter

           - item 1a
           - item 1b

        .. container:: column bg-red-lighter

           - item 2

     .. speaker-notes::
