           Pelops Overview
        
        ``Eurydike`` is part of the collection of mqtt based microservices
        `pelops <https://gitlab.com/pelops>`__. An overview on the microservice
        architecture and examples can be found at
        (http://gitlab.com/pelops/pelops).

        =========
        
        Installation Core-Functionality
        -------------------------------
        
        Prerequisites for the core functionality are:
        
        ::
        
            sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
            sudo pip3 install paho-mqtt pyyaml pelops
        
        Install via pip:
        
        ::
        
            sudo pip3 install eurydike
        
        To update to the latest version add ``--upgrade`` as prefix to the
        ``pip3`` line above.
        
        Install via gitlab (might need additional packages):
        
        ::
        
            git clone git@gitlab.com:pelops/eurydike.git
            cd eurydike
            sudo python3 setup.py install
        
        This will install the following shell scripts: \* ``eurydike``
        
        The script cli arguments are: \* '-c'/'--config' - config file
        (mandatory) \* '-v' - verbose output (optional) \* '--version' - show
        the version number and exit
        
        YAML-Config
        -----------
        
        A yaml [1]_ file must contain four root blocks: \* mqtt - mqtt-address,
        mqtt-port, and path to credentials file credentials-file (a file
        consisting of two entries: mqtt-user, mqtt-password) \* logger - which
        log level and which file to be used \* eventdetectors - parameters for
        the controller and the embedded pid
        
        ::
        
            mqtt:
                mqtt-address: localhost
                mqtt-port: 1883

        -  add systemd example.
        
        For Developers
        ==============
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        The project consists of two main modules:
        
        -  ``eventdetectionmanager`` - manages all configured event detectors
        -  ``abstracteventdetector`` - base class for all event detectors
        
        Todos
        -----
        
        -  ... ?
        
        Misc
        ----
        
        The code is written for ``python3`` (and tested with python 3.5 on an
        Raspberry Pi Zero with Raspbian Stretch).

        welcome.
        
        .. [1]
           Currently, pyyaml is yaml 1.1 compliant. In pyyaml On/Off and Yes/No
           are automatically converted to True/False. This is an unwanted
           behavior and deprecated in yaml 1.2. In copreus this autoconversion
           is removed. Thus, On/Off and Yes/No are read from the yaml file as
           strings (see module baseclasses.myconfigtools).
