=================================================
Journal Entry completion from bank account number
=================================================

This module extends the functionality of account_move_base_import
to add a completion method based on the partner bank account number
provided by the bank/office.

Completion will look in the partner with that bank account number
to match the partner, then it will fill in the journal item with
it to ease the reconciliation.
