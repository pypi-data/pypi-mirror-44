==================
Sale Quick Payment
==================

Sale Quick Payment gives the possibility to pay a sale order from the
sale order itself.

The payment will be linked to the sale order.

If you install the module Sale Automatic Workflow, you can forbid the
validation of an unpaid order and the invoice will be automatically
reconciled with the payment.

This module was originally designed for the e-commerce sector, but it
does not preclude to use it in other sectors.


Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to to configure the payment methods which
come from the `sale_payment_method` module.

Usage
=====

Use the "Register Payments" button on the sale order to flag the order as
paid.
