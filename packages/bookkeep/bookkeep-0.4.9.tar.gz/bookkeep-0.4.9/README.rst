What is bookkeep?
-----------------

bookkeep is a python package for keeping track of units of measure, measurment bounds, and immutable items. The package mainly features the SmartBook, a dictionary subclass that incorporates `pint Quantity objects  <https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ for managing units of measure.

Installation

Getting started
---------------

**SmartBook objects are dictionaries that provide an easy way to keep track of units of measure and enforce bounds.**
    
Create a `SmartBook <https://bookkeep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SmartBook.html>`__ object with *units*, *bounds*, a *source* description, and arguments to initialize the dictionary:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> sb = SmartBook(units={'T': 'K', 'Duty': 'kJ/hr'},
    ...                bounds={'T': (0, 1000)},
    ...                source='Operating conditions',
    ...                T=350)
    >>> sb
    {'T': 350 (K)}

The *units* attribute becomes a `UnitManager <https://bookkeep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UnitManager.html>`__ object with a reference to all dictionaries (*clients*) it controls. These include the SmartBook and its bounds.

.. code-block:: python    
    
    >>> sb.units
    UnitManager:
    {'T': 'degC',
     'Duty': 'kJ/hr'}
    >>> sb.units.clients
    [{'T': 350 (K)}, {'T': (0, 1000)}]

Change units:

.. code-block:: python
    
    >>> sb.units['T'] = 'degC'
    >>> sb
    {'T': 76.85 (degC)}
    >>> sb.bounds
    {'T': array([ -273.15, 726.85])}

Add items:

.. code-block:: python    
        
    >>> sb['P'] = 101325
    >>> sb
    {'T': 76.85 (degC),
     'P': 101325}
    
Add units:

.. code-block:: python    
        
    >>> sb.units['P'] = 'Pa'
    >>> sb
    {'T': 76.85 (degC),
     'P': 101325 (Pa)}
     
A BookkeepWarning is issued when a value is set out of bounds:

.. code-block:: python
                
    >>> sb['T'] = -300
    __main__:1: BookkeepWarning: @Operating conditions: T (-300 degC) is out of bounds (-273.15 to 726.85 degC).

**Nested SmartBook objects are easy to read, and can be made using the same units and bounds.**

Create new SmartBook objects:

.. code-block:: python    
    
    >>> sb1 = SmartBook(sb.units, sb.bounds,
    ...                 T=25, P=500)
    >>> sb2 = SmartBook(sb.units, sb.bounds,
    ...                 T=50, Duty=50)
    >>> sb1
    {'T': 25 (degC),
     'P': 500 (Pa)}
    >>> sb2
    {'T': 50 (degC),
     'Duty': 50 (kJ/hr)})
    
Create nested SmartBook:
    
.. code-block:: python    
    
    >>> nsb = SmartBook(sb1=sb1, sb2=sb2)
    {'sb1':
        {'T': 25 (degC),
         'P': 500 (Pa)},
     'sb2':
        {'T': 50 (degC),
         'Duty': 50 (kg/hr)}}
    
**Pint** `Quantity <https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ **objects are also compatible, so long as the corresponding Quantity class is set as the Quantity attribute.**

Set a Quantity object:
    
.. code-block:: python
     
    >>> Q_ = SmartBook.Quantity
    >>> sb1.bounds['T'] = Q_((0, 1000), 'K')
    >>> sb1['T'] = Q_(100, 'K')
    >>> sb1
    {'T': -173.15 degC,
     'P': 500 (Pa)}

Setting a Quantity object out of bounds will issue a warning:

.. code-block:: python 
    
    >>> sb1['T'] = Q_(-1, 'K')
     __main__:1: BookkeepWarning: T (-274.15 degC) is out of bounds (-273.15 to 726.85 degC).

Trying to set a Quantity object with wrong dimensions will raise an error:

.. code-block:: python
    
    >>> Q_ = SmartBook.Quantity    
    >>> sb1['T'] = Q_(100, 'meter')
    DimensionalityError: Cannot convert from 'meter' ([length]) to 'degC' ([temperature])

.. Note:: Numpy arrays are also compatible with bounds checking. Give it a shot!
