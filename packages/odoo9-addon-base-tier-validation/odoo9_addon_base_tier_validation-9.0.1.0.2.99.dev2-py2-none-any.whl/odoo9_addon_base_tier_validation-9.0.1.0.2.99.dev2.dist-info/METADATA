====================
Base Tier Validation
====================

This module does not provide a functionality by itself but an abstract model
to implement a validation process based on tiers on other models (e.g.
purchase orders, sales orders...).

**Note:** To be able to use this module in a new model you will need some
development.

See `purchase_tier_validation <https://github
.com/OCA/purchase-workflow>`_ as an example of implementation.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Settings > Technical > Tier Validations > Tier Definition*.
#. Create as many tiers as you want for any model having tier validation
   functionality.
