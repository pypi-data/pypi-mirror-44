Description: # What's this?
        Cost basis calculation library and HTTP API.
        
        # Requirements and python deps
        python3 is required, as are flask and dateutil.
        
        black is used for code formatting, so python3.7 is useful as black requires that.
        
        Note that `pip freeze` outputs incorrect dependencies by default on Ubuntu.
        
        # Running it
        Running and testing in development mode: 
        
        ```
        source ./venv/bin/activate
        curl -X POST -d BUILD localhost:5000/upload/rk
        ```
        
        1) `PYTHONPATH=../ python3 application.py`
        2) `bazel run :application # Currently broken due to python path issue`
        3) deploy to elastic beanstalk
        
        
        # Notes
        Inspired by package structure and test layout of python modules sshuttle and flask.
