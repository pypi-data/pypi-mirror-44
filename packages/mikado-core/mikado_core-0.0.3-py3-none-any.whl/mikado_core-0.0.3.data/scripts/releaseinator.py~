releaseinator is a quick but hopefully useful script to 
help pushout and release python packages. It needs to work with mkrepo
and somehow 'validate and clean up' packages to meet best practise, and
will need to use twine to push code up to pypi and push changes to git.

Versions and releases
I want to have a version bump approach - 

PyPi
I want to release a package up to pypi easily without having to look up how
each time.
