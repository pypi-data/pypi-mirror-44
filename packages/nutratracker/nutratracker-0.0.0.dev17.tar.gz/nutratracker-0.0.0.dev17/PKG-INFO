            rm nutri.zip
        
        Windows (web download)
        ----------------------
        Download :code:`nutri.zip`:
        
        https://bitbucket.org/dasheenster/nutri-utils/downloads/
        
        Extract the :code:`.nutri` folder to your home folder.
        
        
        - On Windows this is :code:`C:\Users\<your_name>`
        - On macOS it's :code:`/Users/<your_name>`
        - On Linux it's :code:`/home/<your_name>`
        
        These can also be downloaded from the Android app, or synced over USB cable.
        
        You can also import your own flat file databases.  The full database import process is explained with :code:`nutri db --help`
        
        Better directions for getting set up (on Windows) will (eventually) be posted `on youtube <https://www.youtube.com/user/gamesguru>`_.
