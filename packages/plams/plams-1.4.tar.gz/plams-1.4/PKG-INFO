Description: PLAMS is a library providing powerful, flexible and easily extendable Python interface to molecular modeling programs. It takes care of input preparation, job execution, file management and output data extraction. It helps with building advanced data workflows that can be executed in parallel, either locally or by submitting to a resource manager queue.
