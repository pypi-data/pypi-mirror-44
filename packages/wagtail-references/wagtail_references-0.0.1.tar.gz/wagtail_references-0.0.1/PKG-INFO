Description: # Wagtail References [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/thclark/wagtail_references.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/thclark/wagtail_references)
        
        BibTeX based  bibliography 
        
        ## Templates
        
        **"But, where are the templates?!"** is a natural question. Answer: There aren't any templates or tags so far...
        I run all my wagtail installations in headless mode with a react front end, so can only justify putting in place the
        templates for managing the references on wagtail.
        If you'd like to do so, I'm very open to collaboration :)
        
        I might get around to adding some templates for the listings shown in wagtail, as they're currently pretty ugly (showing
         the raw BibTeX) but will see if this project gets some traction and user first.
          
        ## Displaying references on the front end
        
        
          
        ## Requirements
        
        Wagtail References is tested on Django 2.1 or later and Wagtail 2.3 or later.
        
        ## Supported Versions
        
        Python: 3.6
        
        Django: 2.1
        
        Wagtail: 2.3
        
        ## Getting started
        
        Installing from pip:
        
        ```
        pip install wagtail_references
        ```
        
        Adding to `INSTALLED_APPS`:
        
        ```python
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            ...
            'wagtail_references',
            ...
        ]
        ```
        
        Running the migrations:
        
        ```
        python manage migrate wagtail_references
        ```
        
        ## Reference Model
        
        There's only one database model ``Reference``, which is registered as a snippet in Wagtail, making it searchable and
        selectable.
