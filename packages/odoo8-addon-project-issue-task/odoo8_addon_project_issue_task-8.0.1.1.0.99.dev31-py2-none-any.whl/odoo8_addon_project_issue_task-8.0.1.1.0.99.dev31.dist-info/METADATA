Support for the use case where solving an Issue means a Task should be done,
such as an on site visit, and a report must be made to document the work done.
This is a common scenario in technical field services.

The Issue form already has a "Task" field, allowing to create a Task related
to an Issue.
This module adds some usability improvements:

  * "Create Task" button on the Issue form
  * Automaticaly Close the Issue when the Task is Closed
  * Automatically Cancel the Task when Issue is Cancelled
  * Make the Task also visible to all followers of the related Issue
