Description: MRIQC provides a series of image processing workflows to extract and compute a series of NR (no-reference), IQMs (image quality metrics) to be used in QAPs (quality assessment protocols) for MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This open-source neuroimaging data processing tool is being developed as a part of the MRI image analysis and reproducibility platform offered by the CRN. This pipeline derives from, and is heavily influenced by, the PCP Quality Assessment Protocol. This tool extracts a series of IQMs from structural and functional MRI data. It is also scheduled to add diffusion MRI to the target imaging families.
