PyWavelets - Wavelet Transforms in Python
=========================================

PyWavelets is open source wavelet transform software for Python_. It combines
a simple high level interface with low level C and Cython performance.

PyWavelets is very easy to use and get started with. Just install the package,
open the Python interactive shell and type:

  .. sourcecode:: python

    >>> import pywt
    >>> cA, cD = pywt.dwt([1, 2, 3, 4], 'db1')

Voil√†! Computing wavelet transforms has never been so simple :)

Here is a slightly more involved example of applying a digital wavelet
transform to an image:

.. plot:: pyplots/camera_approx_detail.py

Main features
-------------

The main features of PyWavelets are:

  * 1D, 2D and nD Forward and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT and IDWT)
  * 1D, 2D and nD Multilevel DWT and IDWT
  * 1D, 2D and nD Stationary Wavelet Transform (Undecimated Wavelet Transform)
  * 1D and 2D Wavelet Packet decomposition and reconstruction
  * 1D Continuous Wavelet Transform
  * Computing Approximations of wavelet and scaling functions
  * Over 100 `built-in wavelet filters`_ and support for custom wavelets
  * Single and double precision calculations
  * Real and complex calculations
  * Results compatible with Matlab Wavelet Toolbox (TM)
