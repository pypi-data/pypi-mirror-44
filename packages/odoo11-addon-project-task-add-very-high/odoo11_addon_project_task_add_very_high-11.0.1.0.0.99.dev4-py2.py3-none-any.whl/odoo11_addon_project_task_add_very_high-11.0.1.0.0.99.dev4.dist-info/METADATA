==========================
Project Task Add Very High
==========================

This module extends the field `priority` in project tasks, adding two new levels of priority.
The two new levels of priority are: `High` and `Very High`.


On a task form, the priority widget is displayed with three stars instead of one:

.. figure:: static/description/image.png
   :alt: On form, priority widget shows three stars instead of one


On a Kanban view, the priority widget is displayed as well with three stars instead of one:

.. figure:: static/description/image2.png
   :alt: On kanban, priority widget shows three stars instead of one


Without having this module installed, on the form it would look like as that:

.. figure:: static/description/image_a.png
   :alt: On form, priority widget shows one star

and on Kanban:

.. figure:: static/description/image2_a.png
   :alt: On kanban, priority widget shows one star

In case this module is uninstalled, all the tasks that were previously set as `High` or `Very High` priority will be converted to `Normal` priority.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Open a task or create a new one
#. On the priority widget, three stars are displayed (instead of one)
#. Click on the second star: the priority of this task is now set to `High`
#. Click on the third star: the priority of this task is now set to `Very High`
