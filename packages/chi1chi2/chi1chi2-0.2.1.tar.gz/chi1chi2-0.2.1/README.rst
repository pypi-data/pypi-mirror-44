`chi1chi2` program
======================

The aim of the program is to calculate linear (refractive indices) and nonlinear (*chi(2)*
for second harmonic generation) optical properties of organic crystals.

Installation
------------

**The easy path** with docker image:

workdir=$(pwd) # or any other directory of your choice

docker run -v $(workdir):/chi1chi2 -it tomeks86/python-chi1chi2 bash

**The hard path**

*Warning*: manual installation and getting the program to its full functionality
requires quite much of expertise even in linux (I do not give any warranty that it is
possible to run it in any other OS) and can be a very daunting task.

Make sure you have installed:
 - gfortran
 - python 3.6
 - open babel

Installation:
 - pip install chi1chi2
 - for the fortran programs a Makefile is provided with the repository:
   *make* command builds the programs in the build/ directory

Description
-----------

The whole program constitutes a set of scripts that need to be executed in order.

There are four main steps:

1. Input preparation (optionally - geometry optimization)
2. Optical properties of molecular sub-units calculations
3. Calculations of bulk properties
4. Analysis of the results

The purpose of this file is to lead the user through all these steps.


Step *1* - Input preparation
____________________________

A) from Cif (easy path)

use *chi.from_cif* to get geometry for further optimization with *e.g.* crystal09/14/..

B) from fractional coordinates

use *chi.from_fra* script (see: examples/mna_cif.fra, examples/mna_cif2.fra to see the convention)
(remember to adjust the symmetry operations!)

C) manually

see examples for the convention


Step *1a* after geometry optimization
_____________________________________

D) use *chi.from_crystal* script to adjust the coordinates and charges after *crystal* geometry optimization

E) run *chi.input_preparator* script to get input files for:

- *charge_generator* program (example usage: *charge_generator < chg1.inp*)
- Lorentz tensor with *lorentz* program (example usage: *lorentz < lorentz.inp > L.dat*)


Step *2* - property calculation
_______________________________

Use sets of charges, geometries and follow your favorite property calculation procedure.
Additional shell scripts could be provided in later releases.

Step *3* - core calculations
____________________________

Use the script *chi.main* to get the `chi(1)` and `chi(2)` tensor components in the so called ab'c* reference frame.

Q-LFT calculations enabled! (since 0.1.1)

Step *4* - result analysis
__________________________

Use the script *chi.analyze* with output file generated in step 3

- Refractive indices analysis (since 0.1.3)
- Magnitude of the `chi(2)` tensor components in the direction of the optical indicatrix (since 0.1.3)


Helpers
-------

Two helper scripts are available to use around molecular calculations:
 - *read_g09.py* for reading the molecular properties after the QC calculations
 - *scale_props.py* for scaling the static properties with use of the reference calculations

Note: the scripts minimize depencencies on the project library so that they could
be used as standalone scripts on an external machine

Examples
--------

See the examples/examples.pdf to follow the steps used in the integration tests.
The files used for the tests are located in the tests/integration directory:

- *input* as a starting point
- *expected* as a reference

Example gaussian09 input file for calculations could be found in examples/mna.com
