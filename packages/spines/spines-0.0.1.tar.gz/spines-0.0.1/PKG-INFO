Description: # Spines
        
        **Skeletons for parameterized models.**
        
        ## About
        
        The spines package was built in order bring some support and standardization
        for data models in Python.  It provides a common interface for building any
        type of model and also provides tools for working with those models.  It was
        built since so many disparate libraries are used for data science/modeling all
        with different interfaces.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install spines use your package manager of choice, an example using `pipenv`
        would be:
        
        ```bash
        $ pipenv install spines
        ```
        
        
        ## Quickstart
