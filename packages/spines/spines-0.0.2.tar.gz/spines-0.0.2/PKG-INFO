        ## About
        
        Spines was built to provide a skeleton for Model classes: a common interface 
        for users to build models around (with some tools and utilities which take
        advantage of having the commonalities).  It's similar, in structure, to some
        of scikit-learn's underlying Estimator classes - but with a unified set of
        functions for all models, namely:
        
        - Build
        - Fit
        - Transform
        
        The transform method is the only one that's required, though the other two are 
        likely useful most of the time.  Spines is **absolutely not** a replacement for 
        scikit-learn (or any other data/machine-learning library) it's simply a useful 
        framework for building your own models (leveraging *any* library) in a 
        standardized and convenient way.
