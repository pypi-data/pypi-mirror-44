Description: # Fig: The Data Science Framework
        
        ## Supported Commands
        
        ### fig new
        
        `$ fig new <name>`
        
        This would take the `<name>` you provided and create a whole new python project, that looks similar to the diretory layout in the [directory design](./directory.md) in a sub-directory named `<name>` directory. You have to `cd` into that folder. This will give you the basic structure to immediately get started.
        
        ### fig serve
        
        `$ fig serve`
        
        This command starts up a development mode server to allow for local API testing, in the foreground. Stop it with `CTL+C`.
