Description: ================================
         Prototype for CRDTs for Python
        ================================
        
        We implement several CRDTs in Python.  Those implementations are prototypical,
        meaning we don't intend them to be production-code, but to allow exploration
        of the subtleties around CRDTs so that we can implement them elsewhere.
