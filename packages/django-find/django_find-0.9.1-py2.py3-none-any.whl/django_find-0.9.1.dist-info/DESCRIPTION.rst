django-find is a Django app that makes it easy to add complex
search functionality to your project. It supports two different ways
to search your Django models: Query-based, or JSON-based.

By query-based, we mean that you can use statements like these
to search (filter) your model:

- `hello world`
- `author:"robert frost" and (title:road or chapter:2)`

You can also create complex multi-model searches/filters by
using a JSON-based query.

Checkout the README.md on Github for more information.
