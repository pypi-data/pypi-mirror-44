Stock Packaging Usability UL
============================

Usage
=====

This module modifies the behavior of the buttons *Put in new pack*
(native button) and *Put residual in one pack* (provided by the module
*stock_packing_usability*) of the *Transfer* wizard : when you clicks
on those buttons, it will ask you to select the logistical unit (object
*product.ul*) of the package.
