    A simple container type used by the reference parser to communicate

    Most of the state is dedicated to monitoring referenceable tags and
    creating references to them. The engine and built-in tags rely on a
    set of attributes to function properly. A description of acceptable
    use of these attributes is provided here. Any other use may lead to
    unexpected behavior. Custom tags may define and use any attributes
    that are not explicitly documented as they chose.

    This class allows for a containment check using ``in`` in preferece
    to :py:func:`hasattr`.

    .. py:attribute:: registry

       ``Mapping``

       A subtype of :py:class:`dict` that follows the same rules as
       :py:data:`~imprint.core.tags.tag_registry`. Normally a reference
       to that attribute.

       Implemented as a read-only property.

    .. py:attribute:: references

       :py:class:`ReferenceMap`

       A multi-level mapping type that allows references to be fetched
       and set by role and attribute. Access to this map is performed by
       providing a tuple ``(role, attribute, key)``. For example::

           state.references['figure', 'id', 'my_figure']

       The map's values may be of any type, as long as they can be
       converted to the desired content using :py:class:`str`.

       The map is mutable at this stage in the processing. It
       accumulates all the referenceable tags found in the document.
       Setting a value for a key any of whose levels do not exist is
       completely acceptable: the missing levels will be filled in.

       Implemented as a read-only property.

    .. py:attribute:: heading_depth

       :py:class:`int`

       The configured depth after which :py:attr:`heading_counter` stops
       having an effect when a subheading is entered. If omitted
       entirely (:py:obj:`None`), all available heading levels will be
       used.

       Implemented as a writable property.

    .. py:attribute:: heading_counter

       :py:class:`list`\ [\ :py:class:`int`\ ]

       A list containing counters for each heading level encountered.
       The list is popped back one element whenever a higher level
       heading is encountered. ``len(heading_counter)`` is the depth of
       the outline the parser is currently in. E.g., if the parser is
       parsing text under ``Section 3.4.5``, ``heading_counter``
       contains ``[3, 4, 5]``. When ``Section 4`` is encountered next,
       the counter will be reset to ``[4]``. The heading may be
       referenced later by title or by ID.

       A :py:class:`~collections.deque` is not used because it does not
       support slice deletion, which makes jumping back a few heading
       levels much easier.

       Implemented as a read-only property.

    .. py:attribute:: item_counters

       :py:class:`dict`\ [\ :py:class:`str` -> :py:class:`int`\ ]

       A mapping of the :term:referenceable roles to the counters of
       items in the current heading. All the counters are reset to zero
       when a new heading below :py:attr:`heading_depth` is encountered.

       Implemented as a read-only property. The keys of the mapping
       should not be modified, but the values may be.

    .. py:attribute:: content

       :py:class:`io.StringIO`

       A mutable buffer used by the engine to accumulate text from the
       :ref:`configuration-xml` only when necessary.

       This attribute should be manipulated mostly through the
       :py:meth:`start_content` and :py:meth:`end_content` methods. It
       should only be present for tags that care about accumulating
       content for a reference, like :ref:`xml-spec-tags-par`. When
       present, all content, regardless of nested tags, will be
       accumulated.

class EngineState(_StateBase):
    """
    A simple container type used by the main parser to communicate
    document state to the tag descriptors.

    Most of the state is dedicated to monitoring the status of the text
    acquisition from the XML. The engine and built-in tags rely on a set
    of attributes to function. A description of acceptable use of these
    attributes is provided here. Any other use may lead to unexpected
    behavior. Custom tags may define and use any attributes that are not
    explicitly documented as they choose.

    This class allows for a containment check using ``in`` in preferece
    to :py:func:`hasattr`.

    .. py:attribute:: doc

       :py:class:`docx.document.Document`

       The document that is being built. Set once by the engine.

       Implemented as a read-only property.

    .. py:attribute:: keywords

       :py:class:`dict`

       The keywords configured for this document by the
       :ref:`configuration-ipc`. Normally, this dictionary should be
       treated as read-only, but :py:class:`~imprint.core.tags.ExprTag`
       can add new entries.

       As a rule, keywords with lowercase names are system configuration
       options, while keywords that start with upper case letters affect
       document content.

       Implemented as a read-only property.

    .. py:attribute:: references

       :py:class:`ReferenceMap`

       A multi-level mapping type that allows references to be fetched
       by role and attribute. Access to this map is performed by
       providing a tuple ``(role, attribute, key)``. For example::

           state.references['figure', 'id', 'my_figure']

       The map's values may be of any type, as long as they can be
       converted to the desired content using :py:class:`str`.

       The mapping is made immutable as soon as it becomes part of the
       state. The read-only lock is irreversible.

       Implemented as a read-only property.

    .. py:attribute:: paragraph

       :py:class:`docx.text.paragraph.Paragraph`

        A paragraph represents a collection of runs and other objects
        that make up a logical segment in a document. This attribute
        exists only when parsing a :ref:`xml-spec-tags-par` tag. Usually
        set and unset by :py:class:`~imprint.core.tags.ParTag`, but can
        be temporarily switched off and reinstated in response to other
        tags as well. :py:meth:`end_paragraph` deletes this attribute.

    .. py:attribute:: run

       :py:class:`docx.text.run.Run`

        A run is a collection of characters with similar formatting
        within a paragraph. This attribute exists only when parsing a
        :ref:`xml-spec-tags-run` tag. Usually set and unset by
        :py:class:`~imprint.core.tags.RunTag`. :py:meth:`end_paragraph`
        deletes this attribute.

    .. py:attribute:: content

       :py:class:`io.StringIO`

       A mutable buffer used by the engine to accumulate text from the
       :ref:`configuration-xml`.

       Since whitespace needs to be trimmed rather aggressively from
       an XML file, this object gets an extra (non-standard) attribute:

       .. py:attribute:: content.leading_space

          Indicates whether or not to prepend a space when concatenating
          this buffer with others. In general, the text of the first run
          in a paragraph is the only one that does not have this
          attribute set to :py:obj:`True`. This flag is set on the
          buffer rather than the state object itself so that buffers can
          be pushed and popped into the :py:attr:`.content_stack` to
          handle nested tags.

       This attribute should be manipulated mostly through the
       :py:meth:`new_content`, :py:meth:`get_content` and
       :py:meth:`flush_run` methods.

       This attribute must always be present, regardless of the
       position within the document.

       Implemented as a read-write property that can not be deleted or
       set to :py:obj:`None`.

    .. py:attribute:: content_stack

       :py:class:`collections.deque`\ [\ :py:class:`io.StringIO`\ ]

       A stack for nested content buffers. Each buffer represents a tag
       containing independent content. Some tags append to the parent's
       buffer, some close the current buffer to start a new one and
       others, such as :ref:`xml-spec-tags-figure`, use a temporary
       buffer for their content.

       The stack allows for a theoretically indefinite level of nesting
       of text elements. In reality, it will only contain one or two
       elements: the current run text and the contents of interpersed
       tags like :ref:`xml-spec-tags-figure`.

       This attribute should be maniplated through the
       :py:meth:`push_content_stack` and :py:meth:`pop_content_stack`
       methods.

       This attribute may be empty, but never missing. Implemented as a
       read-only property.

    .. py:attribute:: last_list_item

       :py:class:`docx.text.paragraph.Paragraph`

       List items in Word are just paragraphs with a particular style
       and numbering scheme. All of this information can be gathered
       from the previous paragraph that was assigned a concrete list
       numbering instance.

       This attribute should never be missing. It should only be
       :py:obj:`None` to indicate that no prior numbered paragraph has
       occured in the document yet. To this end, it is implemented as a
       read-only property.

    .. py:attribute:: latex_count

       :py:class:`int`

       A counter for the number of :ref:`xml-spec-tags-latex` tags
       encountered so far. Used to generate the file name for the
       equations if :ref:`logging-images` is enabled. Missing otherwise.

        Outside :ref:`xml-spec-tags-par`
            Create a new temporary
            :py:class:`~docx.text.paragraph.Paragraph` and a new
            :py:class:`~docx.text.run.Run`. Neither object is retained
            (i.e. in :py:attr:`paragraph` and :py:attr:`run`).
        Inside :ref:`xml-spec-tags-par` but outside :ref:`xml-spec-tags-run`
            Create a new temporary :py:class:`~docx.text.run.Run`, which
            will not be retained.
        Inside :ref:`xml-spec-tags-run`
            If the requested ``style`` matches the style of the current
            :py:attr:`run`, it will be flushed and extended. Otherwise,
            the current :py:attr:`run` will be interrupted by a
            temporary run with the new style, and then reinstated.

        It is an error to have a run outside a paragraph.

        Parameters
        ----------
        img : str or file-like
            The image can be the name of a file on disk, or an open file
            (including in memory files like :py:class:`io.BytesIO`). In
            the latter case, the file pointer must be at the beginning
            of the image data.
        style : str
            The name of the
            :doc:`dev/analysis/features/styles/character-style` to apply
            to a new run.
        pstyle : str
            The name of the
            :doc:`dev/analysis/features/styles/paragraph-style` to apply
            if a new paragraph needs to be created.


        Two additional keyword-only arguments can be supplied to
        :py:meth:`~docx.text.run.Run.add_picture`: ``width`` and
        ``height``.
