Description: imprint
        =======
        
        This program is a system for data aggregation and presentation through Microsoft
        Word documents. It uses templates to define dynamically generated portions of
        the document, which the user can construct in arbitrary ways. The content of the
        document is separated from the style information and the content generation.
        
        Using this system does not remove the need to write the initial draft of the
        document you want to create, or the need to generate the data you plan on
        aggregating. This program is only useful if you plan on generating a similarly
        formatted document many times with the same content but different data sources.
        It is not useful for one-off reports or documents.
        
        See the documentation at <https://imprint.readthedocs.io/en/latest> for more
        information, including the history of the project, turorials, and API
        references and installation instructions.
        
        The source and binaries for this program are available on PyPI. The simplest
        installation method is with `pip`:
        
            pip install imprint[all]
        
        The extra `[all]` is recommended for but not required. Installing from source
        is also an option, by running
        
            python setup.py install
        
        in the root folder of the project source distribution. The source distribution,
        including documentation can be found at <https://github.com/madphysicist/imprint>.
