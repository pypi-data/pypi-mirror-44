    """
    Generate `python-docx`_ compatible images from image files.

    Copy image files as-is, or load them into memory. Output must be
    to a file of the same type as the input (except for PDFs): no
    conversion is done, only direct copy. PDFs (identified by the
    ``'.pdf'`` extension) get special handling to convert them into
    usable images.

    The following :ref:`plugins-data-configuration` key is used:

        file
            The (mandatory) file name containing the image.
        formatted
            Whether or not ``file`` is a format string that has keyword
            replacements in it. Defaults to truthy. Set to falsy if
            the name contains random opening braces.

    Notes
    -----
    Using this plugin with PDF files requires the `poppler`_ library
    mentioned in the :ref:`dependencies-plugins-external`.
