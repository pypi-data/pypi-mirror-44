Description: Hippodamia Agent
        ================
        
        Reference implementation of an agent for the hippodamia microservice
        montoring service. used by pelops.
        
        It is unwise to set ``monitoring_agent.log-level`` to INFO or DEBUG if
        ``mqtt.log-level`` to INFO or DEBUG. As the mqtt\_client logs all
        published messages to log-level INFO, this would result that the first
        log-message that will be forwarded to the monitoring service will lead
        to a log entry that this message has been publish. Which itself will
        result in another message and another log entry and another message
        forwarding this log entry ... to conclude as soon as the forwarding of
        log-message with level INFO at MQTT log level INFO has been activated
        the whole system is overloaded processing the first log message.
