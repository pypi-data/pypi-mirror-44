        ## About
        
        This is a ground-up rewrite of the great `pwnlib` for Python 2. There were a
        number of attempts to port `pwnlib` to Python 3, but they all appear abandoned.
        In addition, they still had a bunch of issues with the changes in Python 3,
        especially when it comes to the handling of binary data.
        
        `xply` does not have nearly the range of features that `pwnlib` has (although
        more will be added over time), but was written from the ground up with Python 3
        in mind.
        
        ## Setup
        
        You can install `xply` using `pip`:
        
        ```bash
        pip install xply
        ```
        
        `xply` requires at least Python 3.7 (for `from __future__ import annotations`).
