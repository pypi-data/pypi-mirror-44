Logomaker
--------

Logomaker is an awesome Python application programming interface (API) for generating publication-quality sequence logos.
Sequence logos are a popular way of representing a variety of sequence-function relationships.
Currently available Python applications for making sequence logos are optimized only for specific
experiments, and thus are limited in their usage.Logomaker can generate
logos from a variety of data including multiple sequence alignments, enrichment data from massively
parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments. Logomaker logos
are generated as native matplotlib axes objects that are amenable to subsequent customization and
incorporation into multi-panel figures.
