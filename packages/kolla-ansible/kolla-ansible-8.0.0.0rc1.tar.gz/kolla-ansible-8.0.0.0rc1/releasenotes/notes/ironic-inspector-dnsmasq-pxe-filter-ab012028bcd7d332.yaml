    Adds support for the `Ironic Inspector dnsmasq PXE filter
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic-inspector/latest/admin/dnsmasq-pxe-filter.html>`__
    that provides improved scalability over the default IPTables PXE filter.
    This can be enabled by setting ``ironic_inspector_pxe_filter`` to
    ``dnsmasq``.
