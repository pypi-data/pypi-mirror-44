Description: TERMINEDIA
        ===========
        
        This aims to be a Python library allowing using a text-terminal as a low-resolution graphics
        output, along with keyboard realtime reading, mouse events, and a couple utilities
        enough to enable using a text terminal to run simple 2D games.
        
        The "noveau" factor is that it uses Unicode quarter-character block combinations
        to effectivelly enable 1/4 character "pixels" in the terminal. It also makes
        use of 24bit "true" color for text, not limitng itself to the 80's
        8 color palette for the terminal.
        
        While at that, it does offer a great deal of flexibility to display
        and interface in a text-terminal, and may become an enabler of
        rich-interfaces for terminal based applications - think about a
        Python-only, modernized Curses library.
        
        The idea is to keep this as a lightweight install - with no, or
        as little dependencies as possible.

        Documentation
        --------------
        
        Check full documentation at:
            https://terminedia.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
        
        Also, the ``examples`` folder have concrete snippets and
        some stress-testing code.
        
        
        Compatibility
        --------------
        
        For the time being this is being built in a Posix terminal and relies
        on ANSI scape sequences for all terminal manipulation. It should work
        in most Linux and Mac OS terminal applications (including non-X11,
        "native" terminals on Linux)
