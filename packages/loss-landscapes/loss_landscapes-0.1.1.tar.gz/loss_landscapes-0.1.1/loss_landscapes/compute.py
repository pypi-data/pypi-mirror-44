"""
The main functionality of the loss_landscapes package is defined in this module.

In general, the functions in this module require the user to provide a neural network
model, as well as a function for evaluating the model's loss according to certain criteria,
and returns an array representing the model's loss landscape as seen in a part of some
subspace of the model's parameter space.

The available functions detect which numerical computation library is being used.
For example, if using PyTorch, pass your torch.nn.Module model where a model is
required.

def random_line(start_model, evaluation_f, distance=1, steps=100, normalization=None) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns an approximation of the loss of the model along a linear subspace of the
    parameter space defined by a start point and a randomly sampled direction.

    That is, given a neural network model, whose parameters define a point in parameter
    space, and a distance, the loss is computed at 'steps' points along a random
    direction, from the start point up to the maximum distance from the start point.

    Note that the dimensionality of the model parameters has an impact on the expected
    length of a uniformly sampled vector in parameter space. That is, the more parameters
    a model has, the longer the distance in the random vector's direction should be,
    in order to see meaningful change in individual parameters. Normalizing the
    direction vector according to the model's current parameter values, which is supported
    through the 'normalization' parameter, helps reduce the impact of the distance
    parameter. In future releases, the distance parameter will refer to the maximum change
    in an individual parameter, rather than the length of the random direction vector.

    Note also that a simple line approximation can produce misleading views
    of the loss landscape due to the scale invariance of neural networks. The sharpness or
    flatness of minima or maxima is affected by the scale of the neural network weights.
    For more details, see `https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09913v3`. It is recommended to
    normalize the direction, preferably with the 'filter' option.

    The evaluation function supplied has to be of the form

        evaluation_function(model)

    and must specify a procedure whereby the model passed to it is evaluated on the
    task of interest, returning the resulting loss.

    Args:
        start_model: model to be evaluated, whose current parameters represent the start point
        evaluation_f: function of form evaluation_f(model), used to evaluate model loss
        distance: maximum distance in parameter space from the start point
        steps: at how many steps from start to end the model is evaluated
        normalization: normalization of direction vector, must be one of 'filter', 'layer', 'model'

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: 1-d array of loss values along the randomly sampled direction

    Returns an approximation of the loss of the model along a linear subspace of the

    use the weights before training and the weights after convergence as the start

    paramater space from the initialization to some minima. There is no guarantee
    that the model followed this path during optimization. In fact, it is highly
