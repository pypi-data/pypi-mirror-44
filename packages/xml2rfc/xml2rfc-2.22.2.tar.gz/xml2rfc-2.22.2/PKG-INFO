Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the grammars in RFC7749_ (for v2 documents) or RFC7991_ (for 
        v3 documents). Note that the grammar for v3 is still being refined, and 
        changes will eventually be captured in the `bis draft for 7991`_. 
        Changes not yet captured can be seen in the xml2rfc source `v3.rng`_.
        
        **xml2rfc** provides a variety of output formats. See the command line
        help for a full list of formats. It also provides conversion from v2 to
        v3, and can run the preptool_ on its input.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation of the python package is done as usual with 'pip install xml2rfc',
        using appropriate switches and/or sudo.
        
        Installation of support libraries for the PDF-formatter
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        In order to generate PDFs, xml2rfc uses the WeasyPrint module, which
        depends on external libaries that must be installed as native packages
        on your platform, separately from the xml2rfc install.
        
        First, install the Cairo, Pango, and GDK-PixBuf library files on your
        system.  See installation instructions on the WeasyPrint Docs:
        
            https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html
        
        (Python 3 is not needed if your system Python is 2.7, though).
        
        (On some OS X systems with System Integrity Protection active, you may
        need to create a symlink from your home directory to the library installation
        directory (often /opt/local/lib):
        
            ln -s /opt/local/lib ~/lib
        
        in order for weasyprint to find the installed cairo and pango libraries.
        Whether this is needed or not depends on whether you used macports or homebrew
        to install cairo and pango, and the homebrew / macport version.)
        
        Next, install the pycairo and weasyprint python modules using pip.
        Depending on your system, you may need to use 'sudo' or install in
        user-specific directories, using the --user switch.  On OS X in
        particular, you may also need to install a newer version of setuptools
        using --user before weasyprint can be installed.  If you install with 
        the --user switch, you may need to also set PYTHONPATH, e.g.,
        
            PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrik/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
        
        for Python 2.7.
        
        The basic pip commands (modify as needed according to the text above)
        are:
        
            pip install 'pycairo>=1.18' 'weasyprint<=0.42.3'
        
        With these installed and available to xml2rfc, the --pdf switch will be
        enabled.
        
        For PDF output, you also need to install the Noto font set.  Download the full
        set from https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/Noto-unhinted.zip,
        and install as appropriate for your platform.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.
        
        **Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``
        
        Run ``xml2rfc --help`` for a full listing of command-line options.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 2.22.2 (27 Mar 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release fixes a couple of issues discovered by users who are now
          starting to excercise the v3 processing chain.  Thanks for reporting
          bugs!  From the commit log:
        
          * Fixed an issue with xref rendering where the 'pageno' parameter had 
            been given a non-numeric default value.  Fixes issue #399.
        
          * Removed an unnecessary docker volume binding.
        
          * Added slightly more verbosity when converting v2v3, and tweaked an 
            import statement.
        
          * Fixed an issue with <references> sections where duplicate name entries 
            could be created during the prep phase, leading to schema validation 
            failure.  Fixes issue #398.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.22.1 (25 Mar 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Fixed an issue with section title rendering when there are comments 
            between <section> and <name/>.
        
          * Added a DTD approximation to the v3 schema.  It omits sschema for SVG
            and does not permit text content without <t> inside blockquotes, table
            cells, and list elements, as the full RelaxNG for this cannot be
            translated to the DTD format.  This DTD is not used by xml2rfc, but
            is provided as part of the distribution in order to make it available
            to legacy tools.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.22.0 (22 Mar 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release adds pagination of internet-drafts in --v3 --text mode.  It
          does not affect text output of RFCs, which remains unpaginated.  There
          are also some changes in order to make generated html validate in the
          W3C validator (validator.w3.org), and other bugfixes.
        
          Details from the commit log:
        
          * Tweaked the makefile to provide better diffs.
        
          * Did a substantial refactoring of the text formatter, to carry 
            information of the origin element of each line of code down to the 
            generated text level, in order to be able to correctly implement page 
            breaking for tables and keepWith* labelled elements.  Added page
            breaking for drafts, and added page numbers to the Table of Contents
            when in page breaking mode.
        
          * Moved warnings for missing <rfc> docName attributes from v3 renderers 
            to preptool, in order to always issue these warnings.
        
          * Fixed a problem with local file name resolution that prevented the use 
            of xinclude href without path.
        
          * Removed invalid CSS, and tweaked the invisible space above H* in order 
            not to overlay links in earlier text.
