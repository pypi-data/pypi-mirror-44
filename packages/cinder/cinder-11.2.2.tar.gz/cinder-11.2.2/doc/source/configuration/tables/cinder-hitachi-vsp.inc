.. list-table:: Description of HORCM interface module for Hitachi VSP driver configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[DEFAULT]**
     -
   * - ``vsp_async_copy_check_interval`` = ``10``
     - (Integer) Interval in seconds at which volume pair synchronization status is checked when volume pairs are deleted.
   * - ``vsp_auth_password`` = ``None``
     - (String) Password corresponding to vsp_auth_user.
   * - ``vsp_auth_user`` = ``None``
     - (String) Name of the user used for CHAP authentication performed in communication between hosts and iSCSI targets on the storage ports.
   * - ``vsp_compute_target_ports`` = ``None``
     - (List) IDs of the storage ports used to attach volumes to compute nodes. To specify multiple ports, connect them by commas (e.g. CL1-A,CL2-A).
   * - ``vsp_copy_check_interval`` = ``3``
     - (Integer) Interval in seconds at which volume pair synchronization status is checked when volume pairs are created.
   * - ``vsp_copy_speed`` = ``3``
     - (Integer) Speed at which data is copied by Shadow Image. 1 or 2 indicates low speed, 3 indicates middle speed, and a value between 4 and 15 indicates high speed.
   * - ``vsp_default_copy_method`` = ``FULL``
     - (String) Method of volume copy. FULL indicates full data copy by Shadow Image and THIN indicates differential data copy by Thin Image.
   * - ``vsp_group_request`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) If True, the driver will create host groups or iSCSI targets on storage ports as needed.
   * - ``vsp_horcm_add_conf`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) If True, the driver will create or update the Command Control Interface configuration file as needed.
   * - ``vsp_horcm_numbers`` = ``200, 201``
     - (List) Command Control Interface instance numbers in the format of 'xxx,yyy'. The second one is for Shadow Image operation and the first one is for other purposes.
   * - ``vsp_horcm_pair_target_ports`` = ``None``
     - (List) IDs of the storage ports used to copy volumes by Shadow Image or Thin Image. To specify multiple ports, connect them by commas (e.g. CL1-A,CL2-A).
   * - ``vsp_horcm_password`` = ``None``
     - (String) Password corresponding to vsp_horcm_user.
   * - ``vsp_horcm_user`` = ``None``
     - (String) Name of the user on the storage system.
   * - ``vsp_ldev_range`` = ``None``
     - (String) Range of the LDEV numbers in the format of 'xxxx-yyyy' that can be used by the driver. Values can be in decimal format (e.g. 1000) or in colon-separated hexadecimal format (e.g. 00:03:E8).
   * - ``vsp_pool`` = ``None``
     - (String) Pool number or pool name of the DP pool.
   * - ``vsp_storage_id`` = ``None``
     - (String) Product number of the storage system.
   * - ``vsp_target_ports`` = ``None``
     - (List) IDs of the storage ports used to attach volumes to the controller node. To specify multiple ports, connect them by commas (e.g. CL1-A,CL2-A).
   * - ``vsp_thin_pool`` = ``None``
     - (String) Pool number or pool name of the Thin Image pool.
   * - ``vsp_use_chap_auth`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) If True, CHAP authentication will be applied to communication between hosts and any of the iSCSI targets on the storage ports.
   * - ``vsp_zoning_request`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) If True, the driver will configure FC zoning between the server and the storage system provided that FC zoning manager is enabled.
