Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a library for communicating with a wifi-enabled home thermostat made by
        `Warmup <https://www.warmup.co.uk/>`_. At the time of writing, this only 
        includes the `warmup 4IE
        <https://www.warmup.co.uk/thermostats/smart/4ie-underfloor-heating>`.
        
        Warmup Plc was not involved in the creation of this
        software and has not sanctioned or endorsed it in any way.

        Usage
        =====
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        Import the library, and away we go.
        
            >>> import warmup4ie
            >>> device = warmup4ie.Warmup4IEDevice('<e-mail>', '<password>', 
            '<location>', '<room>', <inital target temp>)
            >>> device.get_current_temmperature()
            {'raw': 21.0}
        
        Device Versions
        ---------------
        
        Supported models:
        
        - 4IE
        
        Since I only have access to the 4IE, that is the model that the development 
        has occured with. 
        
        Supported Features
        ------------------
        
        Many of the features documented in the manufacturer's API reference do not seem
        to work. For example, /tstat/save_energy seems to be broken. This library
        should not implement those broken features.
