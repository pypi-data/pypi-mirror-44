Description: # mysql_tracer
        A MySQL client to run queries, write execution reports and export results.
        
        It is made with the purpose to support SELECT statements only.
        Other statements will work but the features offered by this module will provide little help or make no sense.
        
        ## Usage
        
        This can be used as a command line tool:
        ```
        usage: mysql_tracer [-h] --host HOST --user USER [--database DATABASE] [-a]
                            [-s] [-t KEY VALUE] [-d DESTINATION | --display]
                            query [query ...]
        
        positional arguments:
          query                 Path to a file containing a single sql statement
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          --host HOST           MySQL server host
          --user USER           MySQL server user
          --database DATABASE   MySQL database name
          -a, --ask-password    Do not try to retrieve password from keyring, always
                                ask password
          -s, --store-password  Store password into keyring after connecting to the
                                database
          -t KEY VALUE, --template-var KEY VALUE
                                Define a key value pair to substitute the ${key} by
                                the value within the query
          -d DESTINATION, --destination DESTINATION
                                Directory where to export results
          --display             Do not export results but display them to stdout
        
        ```
        
        It exposes the class `Query`. The constructor needs a path to a file containing a single sql statement and instances 
        expose the method `export` which creates a timestamped copy of the original file, appended with an execution report and
        an export of the result in the csv format. 
        
        ## Development
        
        You can install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
        
        You can run tests with `pytest` but you need to set `PYTHONPATH`.
        ```
        $ export PYTHONPATH=mysql_tracer
        $ python3 -m pytest
        ```
        
        Or you can setup a test run with your IDE without any particular configuration.
