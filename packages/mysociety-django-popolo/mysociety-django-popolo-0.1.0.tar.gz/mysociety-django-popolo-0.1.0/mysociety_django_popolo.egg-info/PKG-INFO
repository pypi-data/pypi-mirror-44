        Welcome to the documentation for django-popolo!
        
        
        This fork of django-popolo is the same as the `upstream code
        <https://github.com/openpolis/django-popolo>`_ except that the models use
        integer IDs rather than slugs, and the models have no slug field. This is to
        enable projects using this package to pick their own (perhaps different) slug
        behaviour.
        
        
        **django-popolo** is a django-based implementation of the
        `Popolo's open government data specifications <http://popoloproject.com/>`_.
        
        It is developed as a django application to be deployed directly within django projects.
        
        It will allow web developers using it to manage and store data according to Popolo's specifications.
        
        The standard sql-oriented django ORM will be used.
        
        Project is under way and any help is welcome.
