        Toolkit for writing new analyzers for **[source{d} Lookout](https://github.com/src-d/lookout)**.
        
        
        # What Does the SDK Provide?
        
        _For the complete documentation of **source{d} Lookout**, please take a look at [https://docs.sourced.tech/lookout](https://docs.sourced.tech/lookout)._
        
        _For detailed information about the different parts of Lookout, and how they interact you can go to the [Lookout architecture guide](https://docs.sourced.tech/lookout/architecture)._
        
        **lookout-sdk** provides:
        
        - **proto [definitions](./proto)**.
        - pre-generated libraries for [Golang](./pb) and [Python](./python), offering:
          - an easy **access to the DataService API though a gRPC service**. Lookout will take care of dealing with Git repositories, UAST extraction, programming language detection, etc.
          - low-level **helpers to work around some protobuf/gRPC caveats**.
        - quickstart [examples](./examples) of an Analyzer that detects language and number of functions (written in Go and in Python).
        
        
        # Caveats
        
        For the gRPC client and server please follow these requirements:
        - set a common maximum gRPC message size in gRPC servers and clients. This is required to avoid hitting different gRPC limits when handling UASTs, that can be huge &mdash;see [grpc/grpc#7927](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/7927)&mdash;. To do so use the included helpers in lookout-sdk:
          - go: using `pb.NewServer` and `pb.DialContext`.
          - python: using `lookout.sdk.grpc.create_server` and `lookout.sdk.grpc.create_channel`.
        - support [RFC 3986 URI scheme](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/1911); lookout-sdk includes helpers for this:
          - go: using `pb.ToGoGrpcAddress` and `pb.Listen`.
          - python: using `lookout.sdk.grpc.to_grpc_address`.
        - use insecure connection:
          - currently lookout expects to use insecure gRPC connections, as provided by `pb.DialContext`
          - python: run server using `server.add_insecure_port(address)` ([example](https://github.com/src-d/lookout-sdk/blob/master/examples/language-analyzer.py#L63)).
        
        ## DataService
        
        When DataService is being dialed, you should:
        
        - turn on [gRPC Wait for Ready](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/wait-for-ready.md) mode if your analyzer creates a connection to DataServer before it was actually started. This way the RPCs are queued until the chanel is ready:
          - go: using [`grpc.WaitForReady(true)`](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc#WaitForReady).
          - python: using the [`wait_for_ready`](https://grpc.io/grpc/python/grpc.html) flag.
        - golang: reset connection backoff to DataServer on event:
            if you keep the connection to DataServer open you need to reset the backoff when your analyzer receives a new event. Use the [`conn.ResetConnectBackoff`](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc#ClientConn.ResetConnectBackoff) method in your event handlers. It's needed to avoid broken connections after a `lookoutd` redeployment. In case of a long restart of `lookoutd` gRPC server, the backoff timeout may increase so much that the analyzer will not be able to reconnect before it makes the new request to DataServer.
