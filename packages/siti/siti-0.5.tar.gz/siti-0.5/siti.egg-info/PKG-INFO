Description: SITI: Spatial Information / Temporal Information
        ================================================
        
        A command-line-based tool to calculate spatial information (SI) and
        temporal information (TI) according to ITU-T P.910.
        
        The command outputs SI and TI information to stdout, in JSON format. If
        the ``-o`` option is given, output will be redirected to a file instead.
        
        **Note:** As there are no test vectors for SI / TI implementations, and
        filter calculations differ depending on how you implement them, the
        values obtained with this tool may not be comparable with output from
        other tools.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -  Python 3 with

        Background
        ----------
        
        The following info is given about SI / TI in ITU-T Recommendation P.910
        (“Subjective video quality assessment methods for multimedia
        applications”):
        
        Spatial Information
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
           The spatial perceptual information (SI) is based on the Sobel filter.
           Each video frame (luminance plane) at time n (Fn) is first filtered
           with the Sobel filter [Sobel(Fn)]. The standard deviation over the
           pixels (stdspace) in each Sobel-filtered frame is then computed. This
           operation is repeated for each frame in the video sequence and
           results in a time series of spatial information of the scene. The
           maximum value in the time series (maxtime) is chosen to represent the
           spatial information content of the scene. This process can be
           represented in equation form as:
        
        ..
        
           |image0|
        
        Temporal information
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
           The temporal perceptual information (TI) is based upon the motion
           difference feature, Mn(i, j), which is the difference between the
           pixel values (of the luminance plane) at the same location in space
           but at successive times or frames. Mn(i, j) as a function of time (n)
           is defined as:
        
        ..
        
           |image1|
        
           here Fn(i, j) is the pixel at the ith row and jth column of nth frame
           in time. The measure of temporal information (TI) is computed as the
           maximum over time (maxtime) of the standard deviation over space
           (stdspace) of Mn(i, j) over all i and j.
        
        ..
        
           More motion in adjacent frames will result in higher values of TI
