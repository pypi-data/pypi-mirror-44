Description: A minimal lock file mechanism, creating a temporary file to signal that a
        specific file should not be touched by other scripts, or instances of the same script.
        
        Created for [Europe 1Â° Warmer](https://www.onedegreewarmer.eu/).
        
        This is module does _not_ implement OS level file locking. For that, see e.g. the built-in [lockfile](https://pythonhosted.org/lockfile/lockfile.html) module, [zc.lockfile](https://pypi.org/project/zc.lockfile/), or other similar projects.
