Description: # profpy
        ### What is profpy?
        The profpy library is a centralized repository for Rowan's various python scripts to use.
        
        ### Why use it?
        Many of Rowan's python scripts/programs utilize similar or congruent functions and classes that end up getting rewritten or even
        copy/pasted wherever needed. Rather than continue this trend of untracked code, profpy allows us to have overhead control over these common functions
        and classes. If a program or script needs to use a class or function, it can just import it from profpy rather than rewrite it. This will allow us
        to standardize some of our code practices moving forward. 
        
        ### Installation
        ```bash
        pip3 install profpy
        ```
        
        ### Submodules
        The profpy library is organized into submodules. For instance, database-related functionality can be access by importing the 
        "db" submodule. For example, to import the function that parses together a cx_Oracle connection object one could do this:
        
        ```python
        from profpy.db import get_connection
        connection = get_connection("full_login", "db_password")
        ```
        
        ### Dependencies
        Python 3.6.7 or above
        
        ##### Current Submodules
        For in-depth documentation, explore the submodules individually:
        - [db](./profpy/db)
        - [apis](./profpy/apis)
