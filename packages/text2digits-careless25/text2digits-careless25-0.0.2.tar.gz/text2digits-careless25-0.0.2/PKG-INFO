Description: ## Usage
        Python 3 only!
        ```
        from t2d import Text2Digits
        Text2Digits().convert("I was born in nineteen ninety two and am twenty six years old!")
        ```
        
        Output:
        ```
        "i was born in 1992 and am 26 years old!"
        ```
        
        I find this useful if using Alexa/Lex to convert audio to text and have to convert the text to digits.
        
        ## Improvements/Issues
        - Still need to add support for decimal numbers
        - Need to add support for negative numbers
        
        ## Acknowledgements
        I have heavily used code from the SO answers from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/493174/is-there-a-way-to-convert-number-words-to-integers
        and improved upon them
