ffpass - Import and Export passwords for Firefox Quantum
========================================================

The latest version of Firefox doesn’t allow to import or export the
stored logins and passwords.

This tools interacts with the encrypted password database of Firefox to
provide these features.

ffpass requires Python 3.6+ and will work with Firefox 58+

.. code:: bash

   pip install ffpass

--------

-  Supports master passwords
-  Automatic profile selection for Linux, macOS and Windows
-  Export to CSV
-  Import from CSV compatible with Google Chrome

Export to CSV
-------------

.. code:: bash

   ffpass export > passwords.csv
   ffpass export -t passwords.csv
   ffpass export --to passwords.csv

Usage
~~~~~

::

   usage: ffpass export [-h] [-t TO_FILE] [-d DIRECTORY] [-v]

   outputs a CSV with header `url,username,password`

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Troubleshoot
------------

-  ``ffpass export: error: the following arguments are required: -d/--directory/--dir``

   It means one of the following (launch with option ``--verbose`` to
   know):

   -  Automatic profile selection is not supported for your platform.
   -  There is more than one user profile for Firefox.

   You have to provide the ``--dir`` option with your Firefox Profile
   Folder. To find it, follow these
   `instructions <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data#w_how-do-i-find-my-profile>`__
   on the website of Firefox.

-  ``Firefox password database is empty. Please create it from Firefox.``

   It means that Firefox currently doens’t store any password.
   ``ffpass`` cannot create the password database for security reasons.
   Just add one password manually to Firefox to create the database.

-  Empty url field in Firefox after importing: the urls of the source
   csv file must begin with a scheme (``http://``, ``https://``,
   ``ftp://``, etc…)
