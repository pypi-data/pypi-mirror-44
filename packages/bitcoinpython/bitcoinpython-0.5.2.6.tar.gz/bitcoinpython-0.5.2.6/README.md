# BitcoinPy: Bitcoin Cash Python library

Forked from Ofek's Bit and Teran McKinney's bitcash.

#### BitcoinPy is so easy to use, in fact, you can do this:

```python
>>> from bitcoinpython import Key
>>>
>>> k = Key()
>>> k.address
'bitcoincash:qp0hamw9rpyllkmvd8047w9em3yt9fytsunyhutucx'
>>>
>>> k.get_balance('usd')
'2'
>>>
>>> # Let's donate a dollar to CoinSpice.io
>>> outputs = [
>>>     ('bitcoincash:qz69e5y8yrtujhsyht7q9xq5zhu4mrklmv0ap7tq5f', 1, 'usd'),
>>>     # you can add more recipients here
>>> ]
>>>
>>> k.send(outputs)
'6aea7b1c687d976644a430a87e34c93a8a7fd52d77c30e9cc247fc8228b749ff'
```

Done âœ… Here is the transaction:
