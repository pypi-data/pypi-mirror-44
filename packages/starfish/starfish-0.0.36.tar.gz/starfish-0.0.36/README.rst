Introduction

The goal of *starfish* is to **prototype** a reference pipeline for the analysis of image-based
transcriptomics data that works for each image-based transcriptomic assay. This is a **work in
progress** and will be developed in the open.

We are currently in **pre-alpha**, finishing proof of concept pipelines for each of the spaceTx
contributors that leverage starfish's shared object model. At this time starfish is mature enough to
support computational developers interested in adapting other assays to starfish's object model.
