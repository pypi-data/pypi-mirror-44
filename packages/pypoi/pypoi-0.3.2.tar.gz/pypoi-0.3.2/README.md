# PyPoi

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pypoi.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pypoi/)
   
An image processing GUI application written in Python under Apache
License 2.0. PyPoi stands for "<b>Py</b>thon Program for <b>Poi</b>sson Image Editing".

It enables you to try the Poisson Image Editing method interactively.
Some examples are already ready for you, but you can also load arbitrary images and try it.

## Installation
```
pip install pypoi
```
Run `pypoi` command to open the GUI.


## What is Poisson Image Editing?
Poisson Image Editing is a technique to blend two images _seamlessly_.

This method is firstly introduced by Patrick PÃ©rez and others in ACM SIGGRAPH 2003.
The original theses is available
[here (pdf)](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall10/cos526/papers/perez03.pdf).

### Resources
There are many resources about Poisson Image Editing and I'll leave explanations to them.

### Implementation in other languages
There have already been several implementation in other language.

## Found issues?
Please raise an issue from [github issue page](https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/issues).

## What's next?
I know there are a lot of space to improve.
Main enhancements are listed in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/issues), for example,
* [#8  Gradient mixture support](https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/issues/8)
* [#3  Add tests](https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/issues/3)
* [#12 Calculation speed improvement](https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/issues/12)

It's more than welcome if you can pick up one/some of them.
