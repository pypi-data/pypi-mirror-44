'''
Functions that given a TargetCollection and any number of kwargs will 
return a list of `target_id`s from the given TargetCollection.

These functions are used to subset TargetCollection so that we can get 
subset metrics e.g. Accuracy score for samples within the TargetCollection 
that have only one sentiment within the sentence that sample came from
