        The swap operator requires an access to two identical copies of a wavefunction. In practice, this translates
        to the requirement of having two independent sets of samples from the wavefunction replicas. For this
        purpose, the batch of samples stored in the param samples is split into two subsets. Although this
        procedure is designed to break the autocorrelation between the samples, it must be used with caution.
        For a fully unbiased estimate of the entanglement entropy, the batch of samples needs to be built from two
        independent initializations of the wavefucntion each having a different random number generator.

        :param nn_state: The WaveFunction that drew the samples.
        :type nn_state: qucumber.nn_states.WaveFunctionBase
        :param samples: A batch of samples to calculate the observable on.
