Description: #py8583
        ###Python library implementing the ISO-8583 banking protocol
        
        This is an implementation of the de-facto protocol for banking applications, iso8583.
        
        #### Status:
        **Things working:**
        
        * iso-8583/1987 parsing and building
        * Support of BCD/Binary/ASCII variations in field lengths and field data (where applicable)
        * Python 2.7 and 3.x support
        
        **Things that will work** (aka TODO List):
        
        * Proper documentation
        * Fully automated unit testing
        * 1993 and 2003 specifications of the protocol
        
        **Things that might work** (aka Wishlist):
        
        * Predefined (and ready to use) popular implementations
        * EBCDIC support
        
        #### How to use:
        The module's external module dependencies are:
        
        * enum34 (for python &lt; 3.4)
            
        This paragraph will eventually have some basic/quick examples too. Until then, please have a look at the IsoHost.py file which contains a simple server which waits for ISO messages, parses them and replies in a hardcoded manner.
        
        #### License:
        All the work is licensed under LGPL 2.1. Since LGPL is not very python focused, as the copyright holder, my intentions 
        basically boil down to:
        
        * You are allowed to use the library as an API in closed source code without it being considered derivative work
        * You are NOT allowed to modify the library itself without publishing the changes in a compatible license
