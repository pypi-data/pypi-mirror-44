Description: ## base-django-project
        This is a base project for django work.
        It contains a handful of django apps that I find useful installed by default.
        Specifically:
        - dj_database_url for extracting a database configuration from a valid DB URI
        - django-extensions for running a more powerful shell
        - django-fsm for easily creating state machines to track complex processes through the application
        - django-simple-history for easily creating history tables for our models in order to improve application auditability
        - djangorestframework for easily creating REST APIs
        
        
        ### Usage
        In your project's `settings.py`, remove all default configuration generated by django.
        Then at the top, simply put:
        ```
        from base_django_project.webapp.settings import *
        
        # place any custom modifications here
        ```
        
        ### Motivation
        When standing up many django projects over a short amount of time, I often find myself duplicating configurations. This project allows any user to quickly drop in their favorite default configuration for `settings.py`.
