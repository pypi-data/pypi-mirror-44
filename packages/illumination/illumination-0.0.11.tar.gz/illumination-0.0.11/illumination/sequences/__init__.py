def make_image_sequence(initial, *args, **kwargs):
    '''
    Initialize a Sequence for viewing with tv.

    This is a general wrapper that *tries* to
    guess what kind of Sequence to make,
    based solely on the inputs. If this fails,
    you may need to specify the Sequence explicitly.

    Parameters
    -----------

        initial : (many possible types)
                This is the input that initializes an image sequence.
                    - single FITS filename, and an extension to use.
                    - list of FITS filenames, and an extension to use.
                    - a glob pattern to search for FITS files (and extension)
                    - single FITS HDUList, and an extension to use.
                    - list of loaded FITS HDULists, and an extension to use.
                    - a Stamp object from the `cosmics` package.

        *args
            Positional arguments will be passed on to whatever Sequence is initialized

        **kwargs
            Keyword arguments will be passed on to whatever Sequence is initialized
