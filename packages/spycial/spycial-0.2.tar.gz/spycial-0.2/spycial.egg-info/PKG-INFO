        Spycial is a collection of special functions written in pure Python
        and accelerated by Numba. The goals are to:
        
        - make functionality comparable to SciPy's special module accessible
          inside Numba jitted functions
        - have simpler internals by keeping all implementations written in
          Python
        
        For detailed information on the functions available, check the
        [documentation](https://spycial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
