====================================
HR Timesheet Invoice Hide To Invoice
====================================

This module was written to prevent users entering timesheet to
decide the invoicing rate themselves. This is useful in companies where
that decision is done by the management.

It adds a security group that controls the visibility of the
invoicing rate field on timesheet lines.

At installation of this module, the invoicing rate field
becomes hidden for all users by default, unless they are added in
the "Modify Invoicing Rate On Timesheet Line" group.
