Framework EMULSION is intended for modellers in epidemiology, to help
them design, simulate, and revise complex mechanistic stochastic
models, without having to write or rewrite huge amounts of code.

It comes with a *Domain-Specific Language* to represent all components
of epidemiological models (assumptions, model structure,
parameters...) in an explicit, intelligible and revisable way, and
thus facilitate interactions with other scientists (biologists,
veterinarians, economists...) throughout the modelling
process. EMULSION models are automatically processed by a modular
simulation engine, which, if needed, can also incorporate small code
add-ons for representing very specific features of a model.

Models can use classical modelling paradigms (compartments,
individual-based models, metapopulations) and multiple scales (from
individuals to metapopulations), thanks to recent research in
Artificial Intelligence.
