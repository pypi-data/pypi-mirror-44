SIMLIN - Simple Image Manipulator for Linux
==========================

SIMLIN is a Simple Image Manipulator for Linux.  This utility does only one thing at the moment.  It takes images in the current working folder and resizes them in the 'resized' subfolder.  That's it.

New images are created in the resized subdirectory.
