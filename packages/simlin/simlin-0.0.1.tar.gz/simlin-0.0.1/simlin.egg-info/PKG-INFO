Description: SIMLIN - Simple Image Manipulator for Linux
        ==========================
        
        SIMLIN is a Simple Image Manipulator for Linux.  This utility does only one thing at the moment.  It takes images in the current working folder and resizes them in the 'resized' subfolder.  That's it.
        
        Version 0.0.1
        
        The end goal is to have a fully functional command line utility that will do various scriptable batch image manipulations.
        
        Usage
        ======
        Change to the directory that has your images.
        
        Type 'simlin'
        
        Select new size and image quality.
        
        New images are created in the resized subdirectory.
