Description: This package takes a whole-genome sequence file and an annotation file (a GTF or
        GFF3 file in most cases) and uses them to create an SQLite database of
        intron annotation information. This package uniquely annotates intron class for
        every intron annotated in the annotation file, so it can be used to identify
        all U12-dependent introns in any genome with annotated introns.
        
        There is also a script called "search_functions.py" that allows one to execute
        various queries against the SQLite database without needing to write any SQL.
        For more details about executing queries, run the script with no arguments.
