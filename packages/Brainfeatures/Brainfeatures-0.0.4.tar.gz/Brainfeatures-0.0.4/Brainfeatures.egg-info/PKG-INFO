        =============
        
        Brainfeatures is a toolbox to decode raw time-domain EEG using features.
        Can be used to generate strong baselines and to serve as a comparison to deep learning toolboxes, such as `braindecode <https://github.com/robintibor/braindecode>`_, or to other EEG feature toolboxes, such as `mne-features <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-features>`_.
        
        This repository contains modified code from the `PyEEG <https://github.com/forrestbao/pyeeg>`_ library and from the `PyWavelets <https://github.com/PyWavelets/pywt>`_ library.
