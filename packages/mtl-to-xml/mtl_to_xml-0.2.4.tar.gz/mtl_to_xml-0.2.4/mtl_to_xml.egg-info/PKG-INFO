Description: ## **Convert Landsat 8 MTL metadata files to XML.**
        
        **Usage:**
        
        mtl_to_xml has three modes.
        
        1. -t Target mode converts a single MTL file to XML.
        The script must be run in the same directory as the MTL file.
        Example: mtl_to_xml -t your_landsat_file_MTL.txt
        
        2. -d Directory mode converts all MTL files in the current directory to XML.
        The script must be run in the same directory as the MTL files.
        Example: mtl_to_xml -d
        
        3. -s Scan mode is the same as directory mode, but converts all MTL files in the current directory and sub-directories.
        Example: mtl_to_xml -s
