Description: Vincenty
        ========
        
        Calculate the geographical distance (in kilometers or miles) between 2 points
        with extreme accuracy.
        
        This library implements Vincenty's solution to the inverse geodetic problem. It
        is based on the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid and is accurate to within 1 mm (!) or
        better.
        
        This formula is widely used in geographic information systems (GIS) and is much
        more accurate than methods for computing the great-circle distance (which assume
        a spherical Earth).
        
        CUDA-friendly
        =============
        This repo is modification of `vincenty <https://github.com/maurycyp/vincenty>`_
        package. Since CUDA has some limitations (it doesn't understand try...except,
        for example) original code can't run on GPU.
        
        Example: distance between Boston and New York City
        --------------------------------------------------
        
        .. code:: python
        
           >>> from cuda_friendly_vincenty import vincenty
           >>> boston = (-71.0693514, 42.3541165)
           >>> newyork = (-73.9680804, 40.7791472)
           >>> vincenty(*boston, *newyork)
           298396.06
        
        
        Installation
