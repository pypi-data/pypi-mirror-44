Changes
-------

2.1 (2019-03-31)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Minor tweak for compatibility with recently released Sphinx 2.0


2.0 (2018-06-16)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: Given that the PostgreSQL-specific prettifier has been renamed from ``pg_query``
               to ``pglast``, I opted to reflect the fact on the value of the
               ``autodoc_sa_prettifier`` option: if you were using that tool, you must change
               it to ``pglast``.

               Sorry for the inconvenience.
