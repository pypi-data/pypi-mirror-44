Description: Syncurity IR-Flow DXL Python Client Library
        ===========================================
        
        |OpenDXL Bootstrap| |Latest PyPI Version|
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        The Syncurity IR-Flow DXL Python client library provides a high level
        wrapper for invoking Syncurity IR-Flow API calls via the Data Exchange
        Layer Fabric IR-Flow via the DXL fabric.
        
        The purpose of this service is to allow users to invoke IR-Flow remote
        commands via the DXL fabric.
        
        A single IR-Flow service can connect to a single IR-Flow instance to
        provide access to the remote API endpoints exposed by IR-Flow.
        
        DXL clients can invoke ePO remote commands by sending DXL request
        messages via the DXL fabric. The IR-Flow DXL service handles incoming
        request messages and forwards them to the appropriate ePO server via
        secure HTTP. Responses received from the IR-Flow server are packaged by
        the IR-Flow DXL service as DXL response messages and sent back to the
        invoking DXL client.
