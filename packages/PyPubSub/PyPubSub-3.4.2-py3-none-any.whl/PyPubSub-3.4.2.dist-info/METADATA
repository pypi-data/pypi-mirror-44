PyPubSub provides a publish - subscribe API that facilitates the development of 
event-based (also known as message-based) applications. PyPubSub supports sending and 
receiving messages between objects of an application, as well as a variety of 
advanced features that facilitate debugging and maintaining topics and messages
in larger applications. 

ATTENTION: the 3.x branch of PyPubSub is DEPRECATED and is ONLY for 
Python 2.7 applications. If you are using Python 3+, use PyPubSub 4+ 
(https://pypi.org/project/PyPubSub). 

Install current release with "pip install pypubsub==3.4" (ensure that pip runs
with Python 2.7).
