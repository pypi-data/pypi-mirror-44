Description: specktre
        ========
        
        specktre is a tool for generating low-contrast desktop wallpapers from
        tiling patterns.
        
        Here are some examples of the patterns it produces:
        
        .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexwlchan/specktre/development/https://github.com/alexwlchan/specktre/raw/master/output/demo.png
        
        It can be used as a Python library, or invoked from the command-line.

        What's in a name?
        *****************
        
        The word "speckled" came to mind when describing this pattern, and I wrote
        the first version shortly after the James Bond film *SPECTRE* had been
        released.
