        `Visit the Aequitas project website <http://dsapp.uchicago.edu/aequitas/>`_.
        
        
        `Try out the Aequitas web application <http://aequitas.dssg.io/>`_.
        
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        Find documentation `here <https://dssg.github.io/aequitas/>`_.
        
        For usage examples of the python library, see our `demo notebook <https://github.com/dssg/aequitas/blob/master/docs/source/examples/compas_demo.ipynb>`_ using Aequitas on the ProPublica COMPAS Recidivism Risk Assessment dataset.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Aequitas is compatible with: **Python 3.6+**
        
        Install this Python library from source::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        ...or named as an installation requirement, *e.g.* via ``pip``::
        
            python -m pip install git+https://github.com/dssg/aequitas.git
        
        You may then import the ``aequitas`` module from Python:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import aequitas
        
        ...or execute the auditor from the command line::
        
            aequitas-report
        
        ...or launch the Web front-end from the command line::
        
            python -m serve
        
        (Note: The above command launches a Web server only intended for development.)
        
        Containerization
        ================
        
        To build a Docker container of Aequitas::
        
            docker build -t aequitas .
        
        ...or simply via ``manage``::
        
            manage container build
        
        The Docker image's container defaults to launching the development Web server, though this can be overridden via the Docker "command" and/or "entrypoint".
        
        To run such a container, supporting the Web server, on-the-fly::
        
            docker run -p 5000:5000 -e "HOST=0.0.0.0" aequitas
        
        ...or, manage a development container via ``manage``::
        
            manage container [create|start|stop]
        
        To contact the team, please email us at [aequitas at uchicago dot edu]
        
        
        
        
        30 Seconds to Aequitas
        ================================
        
        **CLI**
        
        With ``aequitas-report``, uncovering bias is as simple as running a single command on a CSV::
        
            aequitas-report --input compas_for_aequitas.csv
        
        
        **Python API**
        
        To get started, preprocess your input data. Input data has slightly different requirements depending on whether you are using Aequitas via the webapp, CLI or Python package. See `general input requirements <#input-data>`_ and specific requirements for the `web app <#input-data-for-webapp>`_, `CLI <#input-data-for-cli>`_, and `Python API <#input-data-for-python-api>`_ in the section immediately below. 
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from Aequitas.preprocessing import preprocess_input_df()
            
            df['categorical_column_name'] = df['categorical_column_name'].astype(str)
            df, _ = preprocess_input_df(*input_data*)
        
        The Aequitas ``Group()`` class creates a crosstab of your preprocessed data, calculating absolute group metrics from score and label value truth status (true/ false positives and true/ false negatives)
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from aequitas.group import Group
            g = Group()
            xtab, _ = g.get_crosstabs(df)
        
        The ``Plot()`` class can visualize a single group metric with ``plot_group_metric()``, or a list of bias metrics with ``plot_group_metric_all()``:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            p = Plot()
            selected_metrics = p.plot_group_metric_all(xtab, metrics=['ppr','pprev','fnr','fpr'], ncols=4)
        
        
        .. figure:: docs/_static/selected_group_metrics.png
           :scale: 100%
        
        The crosstab dataframe is augmented by every succeeding class with additional layers of information about biases, starting with bias disparities in the ``Bias()`` class. There are three ``get_disparity`` functions, one for each of the three ways to select a reference group. ``get_disparity_min_metric()`` and ``get_disparity_major_group()`` methods calculate a reference group automatically based on your data, while the user specifies reference groups for ``get_disparity_predefined_groups()``.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            b = Bias()
            bdf = b.get_disparity_predefined_groups(xtab, original_df=df, ref_groups_dict={'race':'Caucasian', 'sex':'Male', 'age_cat':'25 - 45'}, alpha=0.05, mask_significance=True)
        
        `Learn more about reference group selection. <https://dssg.github.io/aequitas/config.html>`_
        
        
        The ``Plot()`` class visualizes disparities as treemaps colored by disparity relationship to a given `fairness threshold <https://dssg.github.io/aequitas/config.html>`_ with ``plot_disparity()`` or multiple with ``plot_disparity_all()``:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            j = aqp.plot_disparity_all(bdf, metrics=['ppr_disparity', 'pprev_disparity', 'fnr_disparity', 'fpr_disparity', 'precision_disparity', 'fdr_disparity'], attributes=['race'], significance_alpha=0.05)
        
        .. figure:: docs/_static/selected_treemaps.png
           :scale: 100%
        
        
        Now you're ready to obtain metric parities with the ``Fairness()`` class:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            f = Fairness()
            fdf = f.get_group_value_fairness(bdf)
        
        You now have parity determinations for your models that can be leveraged in model selection!
        
        To visualize fairness, use ``Plot()`` class fairness methods.
        
        To visualize ``'all'`` group absolute bias metric parity determinations:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            fg = aqp.plot_fairness_group_all(fdf, ncols=5, metrics = "all")
            wheat
        
        
        .. figure:: docs/_static/all_fairness_group.png
           :scale: 100%
        
        
        To visualize parity treemaps for multiple disparities, pass metrics of interest as a list:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            f_maps = aqp.plot_fairness_disparity_all(fdf, metrics=['pprev_disparity', 'ppr_disparity'])
        
        .. figure:: docs/_static/fairness_selected_disparities_race.png
           :scale: 100%
        
        
        
        Input Data
        ==========
        In general, input data is a single table with the following columns:
        
        - ``score``
        - ``label_value`` (for error-based metrics only)
        - at least one attribute e.g. ``race``, ``sex`` and ``age_cat`` (attribute categories defined by user)
        
        =====  ===========  ================  ==== === ======
        score  label_value  race              sex  age income

        Input data for Webapp
        ---------------------
        
        The webapp requires a single CSV with columns for a binary ``score``, a binary ``label_value`` and an arbitrary number of attribute columns. Each row is associated with a single observation.
        
        .. figure:: docs/_static/webapp_input.png
           :height: 240px
           :width: 320px
        
        
        ``score``
        ---------
        Aequitas webapp assumes the ``score`` column is a binary decision (0 or 1).
        
        
        ``label_value``
        ---------------
        This is the ground truth value of a binary decision. The data again must be binary 0 or 1.
        
        
        attributes (e.g. ``race``, ``sex``, ``age``, ``income``)
        ---------------------------------------------------------
        Group columns can be categorical or continuous. If categorical, Aequitas will produce crosstabs with bias metrics for each group_level. If continuous, Aequitas will first bin the data into quartiles and then create crosstabs with the newly defined categories.
        
        `Back to 30 Seconds to Aequitas <#30-seconds-to-aequitas>`_
        
        
        Input data for CLI
        ------------------
        
        The CLI accepts CSV files and accommodates database calls defined in Configuration files.
        
        .. figure:: docs/_static/CLI_input.png
           :height: 240px
           :width: 320px
        
        
        ``score``
        ---------
        By default, Aequitas CLI assumes the ``score`` column is a binary decision (0 or 1). Alternatively, the ``score`` column can contain the score (e.g. the output from a logistic regression applied to the data). In this case, the user sets a threshold to determine the binary decision. `See configurations <https://dssg.github.io/aequitas/config.html>`_ for more on thresholds.
        
        
        ``label_value``
        ---------------
        As with the webapp, this is the ground truth value of a binary decision. The data must be binary 0 or 1.
        
        
        attributes (e.g. ``race``, ``sex``, ``age``, ``income``)
        ---------------------------------------------------------
        Group columns can be categorical or continuous. If categorical, Aequitas will produce crosstabs with bias metrics for each group value. If continuous, Aequitas will first bin the data into quartiles.
        
        ``model_id``
        ------------
        ``model_id`` is an identifier tied to the output of a specific model. With a ``model_id`` column you can test the bias of multiple models at once. This feature is available using the CLI or the Python package.
        
        
        Reserved column names:
        ----------------------
        
        * ``id``
        * ``model_id``
        * ``entity_id``
        * ``rank_abs``
        * ``rank_pct``
        
        
        `Back to 30 Seconds to Aequitas <#30-seconds-to-aequitas>`_
        
        
        Input data for Python API
        -------------------------
        Python input data can be handled identically to CLI by using ``preprocess_input_df()``. Otherwise, you must discretize continuous attribute columns prior to passing the data to ``Group().get_crosstabs()``.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from Aequitas.preprocessing import preprocess_input_df()
            # *input_data* matches CLI input data norms.
            df, _ = preprocess_input_df(*input_data*)
        
        
        .. figure:: docs/_static/python_input.png
           :height: 240px
           :width: 320px
        
        ``score``
        ---------
        By default, Aequitas assumes the ``score`` column is a binary decision (0 or 1). If the ``score`` column contains a non-binary score (e.g. the output from a logistic regression applied to the data), the user sets a threshold to determine the binary decision. Thresholds are set in a dictionary passed to `get_crosstabs()` of format {'rank_abs':[300] , 'rank_pct':[1.0, 5.0, 10.0]}. `See configurations <https://dssg.github.io/aequitas/config.html>`_ for more on thresholds.
        
        ``label_value``
        ---------------
        This is the ground truth value of a binary decision. The data must be binary (0 or 1).
        
        attributes (e.g. ``race``, ``sex``, ``age``, ``income``)
        ---------------------------------------------------------
        Group columns can be categorical or continuous. If categorical, Aequitas will produce crosstabs with bias metrics for each group_level. If continuous, Aequitas will first bin the data into quartiles.
        
        If you plan to bin or discretize continuous features manually, note that ``get_crosstabs()`` expects attribute columns to be of type 'string'. This excludes the ``pandas`` 'categorical' data type, which is the default output of certain ``pandas`` discretizing functions. You can recast 'categorical' columns to strings:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           df['categorical_column_name'] = df['categorical_column_name'].astype(str)
        
        ``model_id``
        ------------
        ``model_id`` is an identifier tied to the output of a specific model. With a ``model_id`` column you can test the bias of multiple models at once. This feature is available using the CLI or the Python package.
        
        
        Reserved column names:
        ----------------------
        * ``id``
        * ``model_id``
        * ``entity_id``
        * ``rank_abs``
        * ``rank_pct``

        Development
        ===========
        
        Provision your development environment via the shell script ``develop``::
        
            ./develop
        
        Common development tasks, such as deploying the webapp, may then be handled via ``manage``::
        
            manage --help
