Description: # LilypondToBandVideoConverter
        
        ## Introduction
        
        The LilypondToBandVideoConverter is a python script that orchestrates
        existing command line tools to convert a music piece written in the
        lilypond notation to
        
        - a *PDF score* of the whole piece,
        
        - several *PDF voice extracts*,
        
        - a *MIDI file with all voices* (with some preprocessing
          applied for humanization),
        
        - *audio mix files* with several subsets of voices (specified
          by configuration), and
        
        - *video files* for several output devices visualizing the
          score notation pages and having the mixes as mutually
          selectable audio tracks as backing tracks.
        
        For processing a piece one must have
        
        - a *lilypond fragment file* with the score information
          containing specific lilypond identifiers, and
        
        - a *configuration file* giving details like the voices
          occuring in the piece, their associated midi instrument,
          target audio volume, list of mutable voices for the audio
          tracks etc.
        
        Based on those files the python script -- together with some
        open-source command-line software like ffmpeg or fluidsynth --
        produces all the target files either incrementally or altogether.
        
        ## Installation and Requirements
        
        The script and its components are written in python and can be
        installed as a single python package.  The package requires either
        Python&nbsp;2.7 or Python&nbsp;3.3 or later.
        
        Additionally the following software has to be available:
        
        - *[lilypond][]*: for generating the score pdf, voice
           extract pdfs, the raw midi file and the score images used
           in the video files,
        
        - *[ffmpeg][]*: for video generation and video
           postprocessing,
        
        - *[fluidsynth][]*: for generation of voice audio files from
           a midi file plus some soundfont (e.g. [FluidR3_GM.sf3][]),
        
        - *[sox][]*: for instrument-specific postprocessing of audio
           files for the target mix files as well as the mixdown,
           and
        
        Optionally the following software is also used:
        
        - *[qaac][]*: the AAC-encoder for the final audio mix file
           compression.
        
        - *[mp4box][]*: the MP4 container packaging software
        
        The location of all those commands as well as a few other
        settings has to be defined in a global configuration file
        for the LilypondToBandVideoConverter.
        
        Installation is done from the PyPi repository via
        
            pip install lilypondToBandVideoConverter
        
        Make sure that the scripts directory of python is in the path for
        executables on your platform.
