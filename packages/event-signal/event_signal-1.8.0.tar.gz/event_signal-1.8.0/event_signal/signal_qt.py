"""
The event module was created to emulate Qt's Signal. It is very convenient to be able to have
multiple functions called from one function call. This class was made for that specific purpose.

The main difference between Qt's Signal and this class is that this class does not call the 
connected callback functions in the main thread. It calls all of the functions in the thread that
called the function (or used CallbackManager().emit()). If you are using this signal in a separate thread to update
a gui item it will fail with a pixmap error.

Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> # ========== Using Signal as a class decorator (Recommended) ==========
        >>> class MyClass:
        >>>     something_happened = Signal(str)
        >>>
        >>>     def process(self):
        >>>         ...
        >>>         self.something_happened.emit("This happened!")
        >>>         # Or self.something_happened.emit("This happened!") # Like Qt except does not call in main thread.
        >>> 
        >>> m = MyClass()
        >>> m.something_happened.connect(print)
        >>> m.something_happened.connect(lambda msg: print("Hello", msg))
        >>> m.something_happened = lambda msg: print("Second method", msg)
        >>> m.process()
        "This happened!"
        "Hello This happened!"
        "Second method This happened!"
        
        >>> # ========== Using Signal as a function ==========
        >>> something_happened = Signal(str)
        >>> something_happened.connect(print)
        >>> something_happened.connect(lambda msg: print("Hello", msg))
        >>> # WARNING! '=' does not work! This will completely replace the something_happened Signal
        >>> # with the new variable
        >>> # something_happened = lambda msg: print("Second method", msg)
        >>> something_happened("This also happened!")
        >>> something_happened.emit("This happened!") # alias for __call__ to emulate Qt Signal
    
How it works:

    Signal is a class decorator that creates and manages CallbackManagers for every class instance.
    
    .. code-block:: python

        my_class = MyClass() # Creates the class instance
        my_class.something_happened  # Creates a CallbackManager for this instance
        my_class.something_happened = function  # Adds the function to the CallbackManager function list
    
    The line of code, `my_class.something_happened`, is a getter that calls the `__get__` method. The
    line of code, `my_class.something_happened = function`, is a setter that calls the `__set__`
    method. The `__get__` and `__set__` methods create a CallbackManager the first time it is called.
    Since Signal is a class decorator, it creates and manages the CallbackManagers for every class
    instance. The `__get__` and `__set__` methods use a CallbackManager instance for every MyClass instance.
    
    .. code-block:: python

        my_class.something_happened.connect(function)
    
    The above like of code first gets a CallbackManager with `my_class.something_happened`. The
    `.connect(function)` is calling the CallbackManager's 'connect' method.
