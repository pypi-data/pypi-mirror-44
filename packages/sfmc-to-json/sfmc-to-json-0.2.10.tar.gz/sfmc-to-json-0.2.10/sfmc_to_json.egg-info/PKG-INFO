Description: # Salesforce Marketing Cloud -- Response to JSON
        
        This is a small utility library that I built to process responses from the [Salesforce Marketing Cloud SDK](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/FuelSDK-Python). It returns JSON payloads sometimes and other times it will return a list of SUDS objects.
        
        ## Installation
        
        pip install sfmc-to-json
        
        ## Rebuild Package
        
        1. Update version in `setup.py` and `__init__.py`
        2. `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
        3. `twine upload dist/*` 
        
        ## Known Issues
        
        Sometimes error messages come back and will be malformed. They will be valid JSON, but you'll see extraneous data in them.
