ML-Dash, A Beautiful Visualization Dashboard for Machine Learning
=================================================================

`Downloads <http://pepy.tech/project/ml-dash>`__

ML-dash replaces visdom and tensorboard. It is the single real-time job
visualization dashboard for machine learning.

**Parallel Coordinates** **Aggregating Over Multiple Runs** **Create
Movies out of images**

Usage
-----

To **install** ``ml_dash``, do:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install ml-dash

**Note: the server accepts requests from ``localhost`` only, by
default.** In order to

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m ml_dash.main --log-dir=<your-log-dir> --host=0.0.0.0 --port=<your-port-number> --workers=4

It is the easiest if you setup a long-lived instrument server with a
public ip for yourself or the entire lab.
