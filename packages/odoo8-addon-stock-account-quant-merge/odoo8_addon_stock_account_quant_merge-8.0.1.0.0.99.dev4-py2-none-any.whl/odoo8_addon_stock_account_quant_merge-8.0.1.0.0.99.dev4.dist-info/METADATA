=========================
Stock Account Quant merge
=========================

This module is an extension of "stock_quant_merge", and adds the cost as a
criteria to merge quants.

Odoo splits quants each time a reservation is done: this module makes Odoo
merge them back if they still meet the following requirements:

* same product
* same serial number/lot
* same location
* same package
* same unit cost
* same incoming date

The restriction to only merge quants that have been received in the same
date, with the the same cost is very important when the product is defined
with the real costing method.

Usage
=====

The merge is done automatically when a reservation is undone. No user intervention is needed.
