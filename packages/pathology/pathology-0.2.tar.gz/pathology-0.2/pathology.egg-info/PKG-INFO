Description: # pathology
        
        Provide a a subclass of pathlib's Path that adds a static script_dir() method to Path, which returns the Path to the
        directory of the calling script. It could have been just a standalone function, but for discoverability reasons it
        seems better to stick it on top of pathlib's Path.
        
        # Usage
        
        It's a drop-in replacement to pathlib's Path:
        
        ```
        from pathology import Path
        
        print('The script dir is:', Path.script_dir())
        
        ```
