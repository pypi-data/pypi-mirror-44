============================
Purchase Delivery Split Date
============================

When this module is installed, each Purchase Order you confirm will
generate one Incoming Shipment for each schedule date indicated in the
Purchase Order Lines.

This module is also designed for extensibility, so that you can define
in other modules new criteria to split deliveries.
