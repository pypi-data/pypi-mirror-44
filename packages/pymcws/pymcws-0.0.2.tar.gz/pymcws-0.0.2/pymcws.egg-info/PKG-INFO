Description: # pyMCWS
        A python API wrapper for MCWS, the web interface of the excellent JRiver Media Center.
        Th aim is to replicate the MCWS functionality as close as possible in a pythonian,
        easy to us manner. Additionally, common use-cases can be implemented in
        recipes.
        
        ## Usage
        use your package manager of choice to install pymcws:
        
        ```bash
        pipenv install pymcws
        ```
        
        First order of action is to import pymcws. You can just import the package and use
        it as a one-stop-shop-all:
        
        ```python
        import pymcws as mcws
        ```
        
        using this method, all functions and recipes are imported and available via the
        mcws object. You can then initialize a server and start using commands:
        
        ```python
        office = mcws.get_media_server("AccessKey", "readonly", "supersecretpassword")
        mcws.play_album(office, "Ludovico Einaudi", "I Giorni")
        mcws.playback_playpause(office)
        zones = mcws.playback_zones(office)
        for zone in zones:
            print(zone.index, zone.id, zone.name, zone.guid, zone.is_dlna)
        mcws.playback_playpause(office, zones[0])
        
        ```
        
        
        ### v0.0.2
            * api.py now has a method to get a server directly from pymcws object. This allows basic usage by only importing pymcws.   
        
        ### v0.0.1
            * Initial release and proof of concept
            * Resolve media network access keys
            * issue playback commands
            * search and play files to different zones on server
            * first play_recipies that facilitate playback of files
