Artificial Neural Network learning and experimentation tools with live visualization.  
(NOTE: Donot use visualization with large networks :) as it has memory constraints.)  

This module needs numpy and scipy installed.  

Contents:  

nn1hlnb		:: Neural Network with '1' Hidden Layer and No Bias.  
nn1hlib		:: Neural Network with '1' Hidden Layer with input Bias.  
nn1hlhb		:: Neural Network with '1' Hidden Layer with hidden layer Bias.  
nn1hlfb		:: Neural Network with '1' Hidden Layer with full bias(both input and Hidden layer Bias).  
nn2hlfb		:: Neural Network with '2' Hidden Layer with full bias.  
nn		:: Neural Network with adjustable architecture full biased.  
tools		:: contains aimaster's tools like visualization functions.  

Feel free to experiment with aimaster.
