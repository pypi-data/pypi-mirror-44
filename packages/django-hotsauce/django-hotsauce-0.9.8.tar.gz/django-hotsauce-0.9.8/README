See NOTICE file for details.

Welcome to the django-hotsauce toolkit, a full-stack web application 
platform written in Python.  
 
The django-hotsauce web toolkit aims to provide tools for rapid web application
development and testing on top of the Django framework and WSGI.

Getting Started
---------------

Please read the "INSTALL" file for last-minutes considerations
before attempting a build.

Documentation
-------------

The full documentation is being generated using the Sphinx toolkit, 
by entering "make -f docs/Makefile" or "make html". 
 
In addition, to skip building API docs, set the variable 
"WITHOUT_DOXYGEN" to "1" for faster execution time.
