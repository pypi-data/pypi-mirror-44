INSTALL
========

Requirements:

    - Modern Linux system  :-)
    - Python 3.7 or PyPy >= 5.10 recommended
    - Django >= 1.11.xx
    - libyaml-dev
    - pip
    - setuptools
    - Patience...

The old way:

    % sudo pypy setup.py install 

To develop locally, you can use the "develop" command provided by
setuptools to install a symlink to the source directory:

    % sudo make develop

To build the documentation, Sphinx and Doxygen are needed. Sphinx
is used to build the standard documentation and Doxygen for the API
documentation. 

    % sudo make doxygen          # generate the API docs
    % make -f docs/Makefile html # generate the HTML docs (work-in-progress)

Finally you should install djangorc.sample to /etc/djangorc...

    % cp extras/djangorc.sample /etc/djangorc

Then in your $HOME/.profile, add the following lines to enable automatic
django configuration upon login:

    [ -r "/etc/djangorc" ] && . /etc/djangorc
