Description: # Omnis
        Deep Learning for Everyone
        
        ------------------
        
        
        ## You have just found Omnis.
        
        Omnis is a library of deep neural network applications, written in Python and capable of running on top of [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) and [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). It was developed with a focus on enabling fast application of deep learning.
        
        Use Omnis if you need a deep learning library that:
        
        - Is EASY to learn.
        - Allows for easy and fast use.
        - Supports CNN, LSTM, GAN applications.
        - Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.
        
        Omnis is compatible with: __Python 3.6-3.7__.
        
        ------------------
        
        
        ## Deep Block
        
        Omnis has been developed as a backend library of [Deep Block](https://deepblock.site). Deep Block is a platform where anyone can use AI technologies with ease. try [Deep Block](https://deepblock.site).
        
        ------------------
        
        
        ## Getting started: Implement a deep learning application with four lines of code!
        
        The core data structure of Omnis is Application which is designed to be easy to use in each field.
        
        Here is an `Image Classification` example with the [`Caltech 101`](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/) dataset:
        
        ```python
        from omnis.application.image_processing.image_classification.densenet import DenseNet121
        ```
        
        Choose an application:
        
        ```python
        cnn = DenseNet121()
        ```
        
        Prepare data:
        
        ```python
        cnn.prepare_train_data(get_image_from='directory', data_path='101_ObjectCategories')
        ```
        
        After preparing data, you can train your application:
        
        ```python
        cnn.train(epochs = 30, batch_size = 16)
        ```
        
        Now you can use the application to classify images:
        
        ```python
        prediction_result = cnn.predict('101_ObjectCategories/ant/image_0013.jpg')
        
        print('predict labels')
        print(prediction_result)
        ```

        ------------------
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Before installing Omnis, please install Keras. We recommend the TensorFlow backend for Keras.
        
        Then, you can install Omnis itself. There are two ways to install Omnis:
        
        - **Install Omnis from PyPI (recommended):**
        
        If you don't use a virtual environment, you can run the command below (not recommended):
        
        ```sh
        sudo pip install omnis
        ```
        
        If you are using a virtual environment, you may want to avoid using sudo:
        
        ```sh
        pip install omnis
        ```
        
        - **Alternatively: install Omnis from the GitHub source:**
        
        First, clone Omnis using `git`:
        
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/mkh48v/omnis.git
        ```
        
         Then, `cd` to the Omnis folder and run the install command:
        ```sh
        cd omnis
        sudo python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ------------------
        
        
        ## Guiding principles
        
        - __Simplicity.__ Omnis pursues a simple architecture. Designing a software with simple architecture not only helps you to understand the code easily but also helps your painful debugging.
        
        - __Easiness.__ Don't worry about complicated algorithms or theories or mathematics. Omnis will handle difficult stuffs for you. Just learn how to use deep neural networks and USE THIS!
        
        - __Modularity.__ No spaghetti code!
        
        ------------------
        
        
        ## Why this name, Omnis?
        
        Omnis means _EVERY_ in Latin. The goal of Omnis is to make deep learning technologies easier so that _EVERY_ one can use deep learning technologies without headache.
