        A library to facilitate the testing of data inside data pipelines. Results are pushed to a messaging queue of some sort for consumption by applications, persistence, etc.
        
        Supported messaging queues / streaming platforms
        
        - [x] RabbitMQ
        - [ ] MQTT
        - [ ] Redis
        - [ ] Kafka
        - [ ] Kinesis
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Package requirements are handled using setup.py. They will be automatically installed on install or during unit testing
        
        ## Unit Tests
        
        Testing is set up using Pytest
        
        Install Pytest with `pip3 install -U pytest`
        
        Run the tests with `pytest` in the root directory.
        
        ## Circle CI
        
        There is a `.circleci/config.yml` file that will execute the build and the unit tests against Python 3.6.
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        ```
        from dtest.dtest import Dtest
        
        connectionConfig = {
            "host": "localhost",
            "exchange": "test.dtest",
            "exchange_type": "fanout"
        }
        metadata = {
            "description": "This is a test of the assertCondition",
            "topic": "test.dtest",
        }
        dt = Dtest(connectionConfig, metadata)
        
        dt.assertTrue(len([0, 1]) > 1)
        // True
        ```
