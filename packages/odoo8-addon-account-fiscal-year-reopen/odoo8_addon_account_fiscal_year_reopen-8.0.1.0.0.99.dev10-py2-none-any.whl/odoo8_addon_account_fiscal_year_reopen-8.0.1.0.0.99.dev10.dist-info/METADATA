==================
Reopen Fiscal Year
==================

This module allows to reopen a fiscal year after it has been closed.

Odoo advises to make a back-up of a database before closing a fiscal year, and
to restore the database if the user regrets this decision. This is not a real
solution as on restore all changes to the database made in the meantime will
be lost.

Of course a fiscal year can easily be reopened by resetting the state of the
fiscal year to 'draft' using a postgress client like psql. This solution is
dependant on system administrators. This module gives the possibility to
financial managers. (Of course the sysadmin still needs to install this
module ;-)).
