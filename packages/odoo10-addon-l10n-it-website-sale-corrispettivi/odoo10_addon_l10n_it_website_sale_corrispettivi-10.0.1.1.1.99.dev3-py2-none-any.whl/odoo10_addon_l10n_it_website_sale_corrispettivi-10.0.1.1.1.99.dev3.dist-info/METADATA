=================================================
Italian localization - Website Sale Corrispettivi
=================================================

This module adds the *Want invoice* check in partner's address form of checkout flow,
its value is the opposite of *Use corrispettivi* in partner.

Configuration
=============

For unlogged users, the behavior depends on how the partner associated to the public user is configured  
(note that the public user is an inactive user by default), for instance:

* If the public user has the flag *Use corrispettivi* enabled, the unlogged user will have *Want invoice* disabled;
* If the public user has the flag *Use corrispettivi* disabled, the unlogged user will have *Want invoice* enabled;
