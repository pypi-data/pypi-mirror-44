""" Module that contains tests for adapters. The tests require next models:

    Models for basic adapter tests:

        - `ModelFieldTypes` with columns defined according to the rules:
            
            - "id" can be present or not (ignored).
            - Model fields (table columns) must be prefixed with it's type and
              underscore, for example: "integer_first". Types are just lower
              case versions of
              :py:class:`~save_to_db.adapters.utils.column_type.ColumnType`
              enumeration members.
            - Column names in database must be prefixed with 'new_'.
