Save-to-DB
----------
This library can be used to store scraped data from the Internet into a
database without much effort. It can create, update and even delete records in
database to accommodate new data. It even configures itself by default getting
not null, unique and primary key constrains, foreign keys and other info from
the DB. It can work with Sqlalchemy and Django ORM models without much setup.
Then you just throw your data at it and it will take care of storing it properly
in a database.

**Installation**::

    pip install Save-to-DB
