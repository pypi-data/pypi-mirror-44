Typical workflow structure
==========================
The number of nodes in the :ref:`standard library<Library>` can be quite
daunting for a new user, so let us go through a few common use cases to get
acquainted with some of the types of nodes that you can find.


Importing data
--------------

To import data from a file or a database you first need to add a
:ref:`Datasource` or
:ref:`org.sysess.sympathy.datasources.filedatasourcemultiple` node
(Library/Sympathy/Datasources in the library view) to the workflow. Configure
the :ref:`Datasource(s) <Datasource>` node to point to where your data is
located. Connect it to a type node like :ref:`Table(s) <Table>`
(Library/Sympathy/Data/Table in the library view) or :ref:`ADAF(s) <ADAF>`
(Library/Sympathy/Data/ADAF in the library view) and you should be good to
go. The type nodes can often automatically detect the file format and read the
file without any additional configuration, but sometimes you need to open the
configuration GUI, manually choose the file format, and complete some
configuration specific for that file format.


Prepare data
------------
Typically, data needs to be prepared by removing invalid values and unwanted
noise from the data before it is analyzed. This may also include removing
irrelevant columns to save execution time and storage space.

When working with Tables two basic nodes useful for washing data are:
:ref:`Select rows in Table` and :ref:`Select columns in Table`. Their function
is fairly self-explanatory.


Analyze data
------------
There are three different approaches to analyzing data in Sympathy. The fastest
and easiest is to use the :ref:`Calculator List` node. The
:ref:`Calculator List` node supports small computations and is far from
feature-complete at this stage. It
only operates on Table data.

The second approach is to use the function selector `f(x)` nodes. The function
selector supports all datatypes.
The `f(x)` nodes are typically used to define functions that will
be used in many different workflows.

The third approach is to write a full Sympathy node. This requires more work
but is necessary to implement custom behaviour beyond that which is possible in
the `f(x)` or :ref:`Calculator List` nodes. Refer to the :ref:`nodewriting`
for information about how to write full Sympathy nodes.


Export data as plots or reports
-------------------------------
Exporting is useful for storing intermediate or final results from a workflow.

The output from any function node can easily be exported by connecting an
export node, such as, for example, :ref:`Export Tables` - when dealing with
table data, and :ref:`Export ADAFs` for ADAF data. Notice that the exporter
names are in plural, which means that they work on list type input. To export
table data using :ref:`Export Tables`, the :ref:`Item to List` node can be
used to produce the desired table list type. The export nodes are different
from the import nodes in that they do not use an external data source, instead,
the output location is set in the node's configuration. Export nodes exist for
many of the same file formats as the import nodes, making it possible to do
import, analysis, and then export back to the original input source.

For visualization, a few different nodes are available for plotting and
reporting. The most powerful set of plotting and reporting nodes are in the
:ref:`reporting<lib_reporting>` library.


.. _working_with_adafs:

Working with ADAF
-----------------
Many of the nodes in the standard library are only available for Table data. If
your data is more naturally represented as ADAF you can still use those nodes
by letting them work on the tables that make up the ADAF. For instance if I
have imported some data as an ADAF, but I want to remove some of the time
series from one of the rasters. The node :ref:`ADAF to Table` lets me get the
relevant raster as a table and I can then use the node :ref:`Select columns in
Table` to remove some of the columns. As a last step I can use the node
:ref:`Update ADAF with Table` to place the modified Table back into the ADAF.
