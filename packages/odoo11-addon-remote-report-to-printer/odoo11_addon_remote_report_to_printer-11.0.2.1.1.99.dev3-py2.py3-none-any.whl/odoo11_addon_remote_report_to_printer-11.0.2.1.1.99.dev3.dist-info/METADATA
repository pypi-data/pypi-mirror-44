=================
Report To Printer
=================

This module allows users to send reports to a printer using remote's configuration.

A *remote* is an external entity that access odoo. For example, computers, mobiles,
servers... We will identify *remotes* by its name or ip. On some environments,
we want to configure the printers by remote, because users may change their
work place.

It adds an optional behaviour on reports to send it directly to a printer.

* `Use remote's configuration` use the remote's behaviour

Also, this option can be selected as a user default option for printer.

Usage
=====

 * In *Settings > Remotes* configure the remotes printers by usage
