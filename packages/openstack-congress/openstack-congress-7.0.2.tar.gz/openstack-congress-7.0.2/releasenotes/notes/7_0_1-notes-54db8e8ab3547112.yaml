issues:
  - novaclient>=10.0.0 breaks Congress nova driver because it removed
    the methods for accessing os-hosts. To avoid the issue, please use
    a lower novaclient version (9.1.1 recommended).
fixes:
  - Fixed a bug that prevented custom polling interval
    from being specified for Monasca driver.
  - Fixed a bug that caused high CPU usage of cfgvalidator data source.
