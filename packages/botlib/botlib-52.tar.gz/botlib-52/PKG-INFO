Description: BOTLIB is a pure python3 framework to program bots (a botlib), provides IRC and XMPP bots and is extendible  by programming your own commands. 
        Basic functionality is a RSS feed fetcher you can use to display feeds into your channel. 
        BOTLIB uses a timestamped, type in filename, JSON stringified, files on filesystem backend and has timed based logging capabilities. BOTLIB has been placed in the Public Domain and contains no copyright or LICENSE.

        use the ed command to edit BOTLIB objects:
        
         > botz ed botz.kernel.cfg shell=False
        
        
        P R O G R A M M I N G
        
        
        programming your own commands is easy, your can load modules with the -m option.
        if you create a mods directory and put your hello.py module in it, you would use:
        
         > botz -m mods
        
        any command you have coded in hello.py would be available, see the `show cmds` command.
        
         > botz show cmds
        
        a command is a function with one argument, the event that was generated on the bot.
        
        example:
        
         def mycmd(event): 
             <your code here>
        
        you can use event.reply() to send response back to the user:
        
         def hello(event): 
            event.reply("hello %s" % event.nick)
        
        after starting botz with -m mods, you see the hello command added to the bot:
        
         > s cmds
        
         ed,find,hello,log,oper,restore,rm,show,todo
        
        
        I N S T A L L
        
        
        you can fetch BOTLIB from the following:
        
         https://pypi.org/project/botz | http://bitbucket.org/bthate/botz 
        
        
        if you need botz to have access to your local directory use this: 
        
         > export PYTHONPATH="."
        
        this will add your current directory to the pythonpath so the packages in it 
        can be found by botz.
        
        installation is through pypi:
        
         > sudo pip3 install botz
        
        you can also run the bot from the tarball at pypi and run it directly or 
        install with setup.py:
        
         > python3 setup.py install --user
        
        
        C O N F I G U R A T I O N
        
        
        botz includes one program, the botz shell:
        
         > botz [-m mod1,mod2] command
         
        to connect to irc use the -m irc option.
        
         > botz -m irc -s irc.freenode.net -c \#dunkbots -n botzi -z
        
        to use the xmpp module is almost the same.
        
         > botz -m xmpp -s botz@okdan.home -p <password> -z
        
        to use the bot as a rss feed reader, add a feed url with the rss command:
        
         > botz  rss https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/new/.rss
        
        and start the bot with the rss module loaded
        
         > botz -m rss -z
        
        this will start a fetcher that will display the feed you have entered on your 
        channel.
