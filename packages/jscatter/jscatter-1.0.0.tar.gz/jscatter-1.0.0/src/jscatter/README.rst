**Main concept**

- Link data from experiment, analytical model or simulation with attributes as .temperature, .wavevector, .pressure,...
- Methods for fitting, filter, merging,... using the attributes by name.
- Provide an extensible library with common theories/models for fitting of physical models.
- Allowing evaluation even of hundreds of datasets using scripts.

1. **Data organisation**

 Multiple measurements are stored in a :py:class:`~.dataList` (subclass of list) containing
 :py:class:`~.dataArray` (subclass of numpy ndarray) for each measurement.
 Both allow attributes to contain additional information of the measurement.

 Thus dataList represents e.g. a temperature series (as dataList) with measurements (dataArray) as list elements.

 Special attributes are .X,.Y,.eY,...- for convenience and easy reading. Full numpy ndarray functionality is preserved.


2. **Read/Write data**

 The intention is to read everything (with comments) from an ASCII file to use it later if needed.
 Multiple measurement files can be read at once and then filtered according to attributes to get subsets.

 A file may consist of multiple sets of data with optional attributes or comments in between.
 Data are matrix like numbers in a file. Attribute lines have a name in front.
 Everything else is a comment and might be processed later.
 Thus the first two words (separated by whitespace) decide about assignment of a line:

 ====================   ===============================================================
 Line assignement
 ====================   ===============================================================
 string + value         **attribute** with attribute name + list of values/content
 value  + value         **data line** as sequence of numbers
 string + string        **comment**
 single words           **comment**
 string+\@unique_name   **link** to other dataArray with a unique_name
 ====================   ===============================================================

 Even complex ASCII files can be read with a few changes given as options.
 The ASCII file is still human readable and can be edited.
 New attributes can be generated from content of the comments if not detected automatically
 (see :ref:`Reading ASCII files`).

 Additional typical detector images from SAXS cameras can be read/processed as :ref:`2D sasImage`.

3. **Fitting**

 Multidimensional, attribute dependent fitting (least square Levenberg-Marquardt,
 differential evolution, ...from scipy.optimize).

 Attributes are used automatically as fixed fit parameters.

 Simulation with changed parameters (e.g. to observe changes within error limits).

 See :py:meth:`~.dataarray.dataList.fit` for detailed description and examples in
 :ref:`1D fits with attributes` or :ref:`2D fitting`.

4. **Plotting**

 The aim is to provide one line plotting commands to allow a fast view on data,
 with the possibility to pretty up the plots.

 - We use an adaption of Xmgrace for 2D plots (a wrapper; see :ref:`GracePlot`) as it allows
   interactive publication ready output in high quality for 2D plots and is much faster than matplotlib.

   The figure is stored as ASCII file (.agr) including data points and not as non-editable image as jpg/pdf...
   This allows a later change of the plot layout without recalculation, because data are stored as data
   and not as image. Imagine the boss/reviewer asking for a change of colors/symbol size.
 - A small `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ interface is provided and
   matplotlib can be used as it is (e.g. for 3D plots).
 - Still any other plotting package can be used.

5. **Model Library**

 By intention the user should write own models or modify existing ones to combine different contributions
 (to include e.g. a background, instrument resolution, ...).

 New models **dont`t** need to be registered or placed/compiled into Jscatter.
 Models can be defined on the fly as lambda function or normal functions within a script or in interactive session
 of (I)python. Or you write your own local module as collection of your private functions to import.
 See :ref:`How to build simple models` and :ref:`How to build a more complex model` .

 The **model library** contains general purpose routines e.g. for vectorized quadrature (:ref:`formel`)
 or specialised models for scattering in :ref:`formfactor (ff)`, :ref:`structurefactor (sf)`
 and :ref:`dynamic`.
 Models contain corresponding parameters as attributes for later access/documentation.
 The model library can also be used for other purposes and may be extended by users need.

 Contribution by new models is welcome.
 Please add documentation, reference to relevant publication and authorship as in the provided models.

**Intention and Remarks**

**Genesis**

This package was programmed because of my personal need to fit multiple datasets together which differ
in attributes defined by the measurements. A very common thing that is not included in numpy/scipy or
most other fit programs. What I wanted is a numpy *ndarray* with its matrix like functionality
for evaluating my data, but including attributes related to the data e.g. from a measurement.
For multiple measurements I need a list of these with variable length. ==> dataArray and dataList.

As the used models are repeatedly the same a module with physical models was growing.
A lot of these models are used frequently in Small Angle Scattering programs like SASview or SASfit.
For my purpose the dynamic models as diffusion, ZIMM, ROUSE and other things mainly for protein dynamics
were missing.

Some programs (under open license) are difficult to extend as the models are hidden in classes,
or the access/reusage includes a special designed interface to get parameters instead of simple function calls.
Here Python functions are easier to use for the non-programmers as most PhD-students are.
Models are just Python functions (or one line lambda functions) with the arguments accessed by their name
(keyword arguments). Scripting in Python with numpy/scipy is easy to learn even without
extended programming skills.

The main difficulty beside finding the right model for your problem is proper multidimensional fitting
including errors. This is included in *dataArray/dataList* using scipy.optimize to allow
fitting of the models in an simple and easy way.
The user can concentrate on reading data/ model fitting / presenting results.


**Scripting over GUI**

Documentation of the evaluation of scientific data is difficult in GUI based programs
(sequence of clicking buttons ???). Script oriented evaluation (MATLAB, Python, Jupyter,....)
allows easy repetition with stepwise improvement and at the same time document what was done.

Complex models have multiple contributions, background contribution, ...
which can easily be defined in a short script including a documentation.
I cannot guess if the background in a measurement is const linear, parabolic or whatever and
each choice is also a limitation.
Therefore the intention is to supply not obvious and complex models (with a scientific reference)
and allow the user to adopt them to their needs e.g. add background and amplitude or resolution convolution.
Simple models are fast implemented in one line as lambda functions or more complex things in scripts.
The mathematical basis as integration or linear algebra can be used from scipy/numpy.


**Plotting**

`Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ seems to be the standard for numpy/scipy users.
You can use it if you want. If you try to plot fast and live (interactive) it is complicated and slow.
3D plotting has strong limitations.

Frequently I run scripts that show results of different datasets and I want to keep these
for comparison open and be able to modify the plot. Some of this is possible in matplotlib but not the default.
As I want to think about physics and not plotting, I like more xmgrace, with a GUI interface
after plotting. A simple one line command should result in a 90% finished plot,
final 10% fine adjustment can be done in the GUI if needed or from additional commands.
I adopted the original Graceplot module (python interface to XmGrace) to my needs and added
dataArray functionality. For the errorPlot of a fit a simple matplotlib interface is included.
Meanwhile, the module mpl is a rudimentary interface to matplotlib to make plotting easier for beginners.

The nice thing about Xmgrace is that it stores the plot as ASCII text instead of the JPG or PDF.
So its easy to reopen the plot and change the plot later if your supervisor/boss/reviewer asks
for log-log or other colors or whatever. For data inspection zoom, hide of data, simple fitting
for trends and else are possible on WYSIWYG/GUI basis.
If you want to retrieve the data (or forgot to save your results separately) they are accessible
in the ASCII file. Export in scientific paper quality is possible.
A simple interface for annotations, lines, .... is included.
Unfortunately its only 2D but this is 99% of my work.

**Speed/Libraries**

The most common libraries for scientific computing in python are NumPy and SciPy and these are the
main obligatory dependencies for Jscatter (later added matplotlib and Pillow for image reading).
Python in combination with numpy can be quite fast if the ndarrays methods are used consequently
instead of explicit for loops.
E.g. the numpy.einsum function immediately uses compiled C to do the computation.
(`See this <http://ipython-books.github.io/featured-01/>`_ and look for "Why are NumPy arrays efficient").
SciPy offers all the math needed and optimized algorithms, also from blas/lapack.
To speed up, if needed, on a multiprocessor machine the module :ref:`parallel` offers
an easy interface to the standard python module *multiprocessing* within a single command.
If your model still needs long computing time and needs speed up the common
methods as Cython, Numba or f2py (Fortran) should be used in your model.
As these are more difficult the advanced user may use it in their models.

A nice blog about possible speedups is found at
`Julia vs Python <https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/Python_Meets_Julia_Micro_Performance?lang=en>`_.
Nevertheless the critical point in these cases is the model and not the small overhead in
dataArray/dataList or fitting.

As some models depend on f2py and Fortran code an example is provided how to use f2py and finally contribute
a function in Jscatter. :ref:`Extending/Contributing/Fortran`

Some resources :

 - `python-as-glue <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/user/c-info.python-as-glue.html>`_
 - `Julia vs Python <https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/Python_Meets_Julia_Micro_Performance?lang=en>`_
 - `Getting the Best Performance out of NumPy <http://ipython-books.github.io/featured-01/>`_

**Development environment/ Testing**

The development platform is mainly current Linux (Manjaro/CentOs) with testing on Gitlab (Ubuntu docker image).
I regularly use Jscatter on macOS and on our Linux cluster.The code is Python 2.7/3.x compatible code
as some additional programms i use still requitre 2.7.
I rarely use Windows (only if a manufacturer of an instrument forces me...)
Jscatter works under native Windows 10, except things that rely on pipes or gfortran as the
connection to XmGrace and the DLS module which calls CONTIN through a pipe.
As matplotlib is slow fits give no intermediate output.
