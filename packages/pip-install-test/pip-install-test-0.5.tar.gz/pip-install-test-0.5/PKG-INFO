Description: ****************
        pip-install-test
        ****************
        A stub package for testing if pip install is working.
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        The intent of this package is to provide a simple module that can be easily installed and uninstalled.
        This provides a straightforward mechanism for showing that an arbitrary environment is capable of installing third party modules via ``pip``.
        It is not intended to exercise the full feature set of ``pip`` or ``setuptools``, but to provide a minimal existence proof of viability.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Install::
        
          pip install pip-install-test
        
        or::
        
          pip install --user pip-install-test
        
        Import:: 
         
          >>> import pip_install_test
        
        or::
        
          python -c 'import pip_install_test'
