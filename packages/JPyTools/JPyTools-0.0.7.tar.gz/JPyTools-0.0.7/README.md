# JPyTools

DISCLAIMER: This is my first module, so I’m sorry if you don’t like it. | Sorry you can’t see the versions below 0.0.5. I had to change a bunch of stuff about the project. |
A little collection of functions. Don’t forget, this is only alpha, but when it is finished it will have a lot of functions! So stay up to date! Here’s the GitHub link: [JPyTools on GitHub](https://github.com/Jackkillian/JPyTools) And the command line code: ```pip install jpytools```.
