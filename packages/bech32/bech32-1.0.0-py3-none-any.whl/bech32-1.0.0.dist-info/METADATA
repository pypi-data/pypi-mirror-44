bech32
======

Since this implementation wasn't in a place that was easy to use for Python programmers I took it from from https://github.com/rustyrussell/lightning-payencode and published [on GitHub](https://github.com/fiatjaf/bech32) and [on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bech32/).

Install
-------

```
pip install bech32
```
