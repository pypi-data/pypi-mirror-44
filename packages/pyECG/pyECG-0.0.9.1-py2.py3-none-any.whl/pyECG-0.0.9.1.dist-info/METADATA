pyECG
================


pyECG is an opensource Python package which supports read/write of common ECG dataset formats.
Current supported formats are:

1. Physiobank `WFDB  <https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml>`_ (.hea/.dat)
2. `iShine  <http://thew-project.org/papers/Badilini.ISHNE.Holter.Standard.pdf>`_-formatted Holter ECG files (.ecg/.ann)


Getting Started
===================

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing 
purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Prerequisites
----------------------------

To setup pyECG, you need:

1. Python 3.6
2. `ishneholterlib  <https://bitbucket.org/atpage/ishneholterlib>`_ ==2017.4.11
3. numpy==1.16.2
4. wfdb==2.2.1

Installing
----------------------------
::

 pip install pyECG


Basic Usage
----------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from pyecg import ECGRecord

    # To load a wfdb formatted ECG record
    hea_path = "/path/to/your/hea/file"
    record = ECGRecord.from_wfdb(hea_path)

    # To load a ishine formatted ECG record
    hea_path = "/path/to/your/ecg/file"
    record = ECGRecord.from_ishine(hea_path)

    time = record.time
    signal = record.get_lead(lead_name)
    print(signal.lead_name)
