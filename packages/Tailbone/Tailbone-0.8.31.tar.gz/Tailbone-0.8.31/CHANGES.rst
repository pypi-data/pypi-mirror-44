0.3.10
------

* Changed ``UserFieldRenderer`` to leverage ``User.display_name``.

* Refactored model imports, etc.

0.3.9
-----

* Added forbidden view.

* Fixed bug with ``request.has_any_perm()``.

* Made ``SortableAlchemyGridView`` default to full (100%) width.

0.3.4
-----

* Changed vendor filter in product search to find "any vendor".
    
  I.e. the current filter is *not* restricted to the preferred vendor only.
  Probably should still add one (back) for preferred only as well; hence the
  commented code.


0.3.3
-----

* Major overhaul for standalone operation.
    
  This removes some of the ``edbob`` reliance, as well as borrowing some
  templates and styling etc. from Dtail.

  Stop using ``edbob.db.engine``, stop using all edbob templates, etc.

* Fix authorization policy bug.
    
  This was really an edge case, but in any event the problem would occur when a
  user was logged in, and then that user account was deleted.

* Added ``global_title()`` to base template.

* Made logo more easily customizable in login template.


0.3.2
-----

* Rebranded to Tailbone.


0.3.1
-----

* Added some tests.

* Added ``helpers`` module.
    
  Also added a Pyramid subscriber hook to add the module to the template
  renderer context with a key of ``h``.  This is nothing really new, but it
  overrides the helper provided by ``edbob``, and adds a ``pretty_date()``
  function (which maybe isn't a good idea anyway..?).

* Added ``simpleform`` wildcard import to ``forms`` module.

* Added autocomplete view and template.

* Fixed customer group deletion.
    
  Now any customer associations are dropped first, to avoid database integrity
  errors.

* Stole grids and grid-based views from ``edbob``.

* Removed several references to ``edbob``.

* Replaced ``Grid.clickable`` with ``.viewable``.
    
  Clickable grid rows seemed to be more irritating than useful.  Now a view
  icon is shown instead.

* Added style for grid checkbox cells.

* Fixed FormAlchemy table rendering when underlying session is not primary.
    
  This was needed for a grid based on a LOC SMS session.

* Added grid sort arrow images.

* Improved query modification logic in alchemy grid views.

* Overhauled report views to allow easier template customization.

* Improved product UPC search so check digit is optional.

* Fixed import issue with ``views.reports`` module.


0.3a23
------

* Fixed bugs where edit links were appearing for unprivileged users.

* Added support for product codes.
    
  These are shown when viewing a product, and may be used to locate a product
  via search filters.


0.3a22
------

* Removed ``setup.cfg`` file.

* Added ``Session`` to ``rattail.pyramid`` namespace.

* Added Email Address field to Vendor CRUD views.

* Added extra key lookups for customer and product routes.
    
  Now the CRUD routes for these objects can leverage UUIDs of various related
  objects in addition to the primary object.  More should be done with this,
  but at least we have a start.

* Replaced ``forms`` module with subpackage; added some initial goodies (many
  of which are currently just imports from ``edbob``).

* Added/edited various CRUD templates for consistency.

* Modified several view modules so their Pyramid configuration is more
  "extensible."  This just means routes and views are defined as two separate
  steps, so that derived applications may inherit the route definitions if they
  so choose.

* Added Employee CRUD views; added Email Address field to index view.

* Updated ``people`` view module so it no longer derives from that of
  ``edbob``.

* Added support for, and some implementations of, extra key lookup abilities to
  CRUD views.  This allows URLs to use a "natural" key (e.g. Customer ID
  instead of UUID), for cases where that is more helpful.

* Product CRUD now uses autocomplete for Brand field.  Also, price fields no
  longer appear within an editable fieldset.

* Within Store index view, default sort is now ID instead of Name.

* Added Contact and Phone Number fields to Vendor CRUD views; added Contact and
  Email Address fields to index view.
