================
Product Analytic
================

This module allows to define an analytic account at product or category level
for using it when creating invoices.

This module is an alternative to the official module
*account_analytic_default*. The advantages of this module are:

* it only depends on the *account* module, whereas the
  *account_analytic_default* module depends on *sale_stock* ;

* the analytic account is configured on the product form or the product
  category form, and not on a separate object.

Usage
=====

This module allows you to configure an **income analytic account** and an
**expense analytic account** on products and on product categories. When you
select the product in an invoice line, it will check if this product has an
income analytic account (for customer invoice/refunds) or an expense analytic
account (for supplier invoice/refunds) ; if it doesn't find any, it checks if
the category of the product has an income or expense analytic account ; if an
analytic account is found, it will be set by default on the invoice line.
