================
Records Archiver
================

Create a cron job that deactivates old records in order to optimize
performance.

Records are deactivated based on their last activity (write_date).

Configuration
=============

You can configure lifespan of each type of record in
`Settings -> Configuration -> Records Archiver`

A different lifespan can be configured for each model.

Usage
=====

Once the lifespans are configured, the cron will automatically
deactivate the old records.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

The default behavior is to archive all records having a ``write_date`` <
lifespan and with a state being ``done`` or ``cancel``. If these rules
need to be modified for a model (e.g. change the states to archive), the
hook ``RecordLifespan._archive_domain`` can be extended.
