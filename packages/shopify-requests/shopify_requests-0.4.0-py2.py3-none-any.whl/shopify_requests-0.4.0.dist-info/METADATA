ShopifyRequests is an API client for Shopify built on top of the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library.

The main goals of this project are:
- remove boiler plate code needed to do a single API call
- work well with testing libraries like VCR and RequestsMock
- easy to use

There are also future plans to support `http2`, `asyncio`, and `GraphQL`.

## Usage
```python
from shopify_requests import RestClient

client = RestClient('foo.myshopify.com', access_token='abc123')
response = client.get('shop.json')
```
The `RestClient` is the configuration point so that all requests made with it will have the same options.
Some of the options you can configure are:
- Oauth token vs private app token
- API version
- Safe retries
- Rate limit backoff

For more configuration options check out the [API Docs](https://shopify-requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#api-docs)

An additional benefits of using the same client is that it will reuse the same TCP connection so the SSL handshake only has to happen once.
