Description: High level network communication
        
        This tool abstracts network communication to a level, where the end user don`t has to care about
        network communication. Server side functions can be called at the client as they were local. Functions may be called
        with parameters and may return values.
        
        **NOTE:** This library is in development process. There may be big changes to it.
        
        Features
        --------
        - Directly call functions at the remote side
        - Get the return values
        - Don`t care about sockets
