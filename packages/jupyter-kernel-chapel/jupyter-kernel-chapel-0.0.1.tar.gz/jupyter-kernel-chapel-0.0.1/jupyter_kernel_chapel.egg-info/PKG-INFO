Description: # Jupyter Kernel Chapel
        
        ## Using Chapel in Jupyter
        
        It is possible to use [Jupyter](http://www.jupyter.org) as front-end for Chapel.
        
        ### Installation
        
        These installation instructions are for Ubuntu Linux 16.04 (Xenial).
        
        #### Python and Jupyter
        
        If you want to run the Jupyter notebook locally on your computer, you need a recent version
        of Python 2 or 3 and Jupyter installed. The use of Python 3 is recommended.
        
        To install Python3 run
        
        ```bash
        
        apt-get install python3-pip
        ```
        
        We recommend using Python3, but you can also use Python2.
        
        To install Jupyter using pip, run
        
        ```bash
        
        pip3 install jupyter
        ```
        
        #### Chapel
        
        Please install Chapel in shared mode
        
        ```bash
        
        export CHPL_LIB_PIC=shared
        ```
        
        #### Jupyter Kernel Chapel
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install jupyter-kernel-chapel
        
        ```
