Sale Tax TTC for France
=======================

The *l10n_fr* module from the official addons provides Sale Taxes but only in Price Excluded (HT). This module adds Sale Taxes with Price Included (TTC).

If you sell both with Price Included and Price Excluded, you may also be interested by the module *sale_tax_included_excluded* https://github.com/OCA/sale-workflow/pull/63

Configuration
=============

To see the new Sale Tax TTC, go to Accounting > Configuration > Taxes > Taxes.
