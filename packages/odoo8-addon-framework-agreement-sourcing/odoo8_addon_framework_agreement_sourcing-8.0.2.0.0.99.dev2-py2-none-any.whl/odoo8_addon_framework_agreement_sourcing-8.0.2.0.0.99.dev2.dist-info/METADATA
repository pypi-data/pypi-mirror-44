Sourcing with Framework Agreements
==================================

If you have a framework agreement negociated for the current product in
your logistic requisition, a sourcing of type "agreement" will be generated.

This sourcing allows the user to choose an agreement that will be used to
create directly a purchase order at the validation of the requisition. This
bypasses the tender flow.

Version 2.0 brings compatibility with version 2.0 of the module
framework_agreement, that introduced the concept of agreement portfolios.

Also, since 2.0 the choice of which agreement to use for a sourcing is up to
the user. The system will only propose an agreement if there is only one for
the portfolio, date, incoterm, and product selected.
