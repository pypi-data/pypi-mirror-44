### Contributing
#### Building
Install `pyinstaller` and run `build_exe.py`. I couldn't get this to work with Python 3.7 so I downloaded and ran it with 3.6 and it worked.

#### Testing
Install `pytest` and run `pytest -v -s` in the root directory.

#### Releasing
Refer to [the python docs on packaging for clarification](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).
Make sure you've updated `setup.py`, and have installed `twine`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`
`python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` - Create a source distribution and a binary wheel distribution into `dist/`
`twine upload dist/unitypackage_extractor-x.x.x*` - Upload all `dist/` files to PyPI of a given version
Make sure to tag the commit you released
