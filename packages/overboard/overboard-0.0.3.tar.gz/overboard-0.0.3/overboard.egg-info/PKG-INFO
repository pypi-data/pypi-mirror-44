Description: # OverBoard
        Pure Python dashboard for monitoring deep learning experiments (a.k.a. TensorBoard clone for PyTorch, without a web browser)
        
        ## Installation
        
        The main OverBoard GUI uses Python 3; however, experiments can be logged from both Python 2 and 3 scripts.
        
        The main dependencies are PyQt 5 and PyQtGraph. These can be installed as follows:
        
        - With Conda: `conda install pyqt pyqtgraph -c anaconda`
        
        - With pip: `pip install pyqt5 pyqtgraph`
        
        Finally, OverBoard itself can be installed with: `pip install overboard`
        
        ## Usage
        
        - Main interface: `python3 -m overboard <logs-directory>`
        
        - Logging experiments is simple:
        ```
        from overboard import Logger
        
        with Logger('./logs', ['loss', 'error]) as logger:
          for iteration in range(100):
            logger.append({'loss': 0, 'error': 0})
        ```
        
        See the `examples` directory for more details.
        
        - `examples/synthetic.py`: Generate some test logs.
        - `examples/mnist.py`: The mandatory MNIST example.
