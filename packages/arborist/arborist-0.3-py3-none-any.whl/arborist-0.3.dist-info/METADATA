Description: # Arborist
        
        Generate the URIs needed for the BONSAI knowledge graph. Designed to work with the BONSAI [rdf repository](https://rdf.bonsai.uno/) and [rdf website](https://rdf.bonsai.uno/).
        
        Currently generates the following:
        
        * Activity types, flow objects, and custom locations for EXIOBASE 3.3.17.
        * Custom activity types and flow objects for electricity modelling
        * URIs for the complete years 2010-2019.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Installable via `pip` or `conda` (channel `cmutel`). See [requirements](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/arborist/blob/master/requirements.txt), though these should be installed automatically.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Generation of URIs
        
        This library has a number of generation functions; you can call them all with:
        
            from arborist import generate_all
            generate_all("filepath/to/rdf/repository/base/")
        
        `arborist` will write out the [turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)) files in the correct directory structure to commit changes to the [rdf repository](https://rdf.bonsai.uno/).
        
        The RDF output directory has the following structure:
        
            activitytype
                lcia
            flowobject
                lcia
                us_epa
                exiobase3_3_17
            unit
            location
            foaf
        
        The convention now is that each subdirectory has a `.ttl` file *and* and `.jsonld` file with the **same name** as the directory.

        ## Contributing
        
        All contributions should be via pull request, do not edit this package directly! We actually use it for stuff.
