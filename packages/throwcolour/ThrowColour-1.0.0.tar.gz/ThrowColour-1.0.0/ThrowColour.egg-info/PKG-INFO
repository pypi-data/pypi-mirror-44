Description: # ThrowColour
        
        ThrowColour is a small Python module to make printing messages with formatting and colours easier! This module is mostly just practice with creating a working pip module for learning purposes.
        
        ## Features
        
          - Supports different types of print messages with colour coding
          - Support basic formatting (bold, italics)
          - Supports timestamp printing
        
        ## Usage
        ###  Getting it
        
        To download throwcolour, either fork this Github repo or simply use Pypi via pip.
        ```sh
        $ pip install ThrowColour
        ```
        
        ### Using it
        
        A few functional examples of how to use ThrowColour.
        
        ##### Basic Functionality
        
        A basic example of how to use the ```cthrow``` function.
        
        ```Python
        from throwcolour import cthrow
        cthrow('Test 1,2')
        ```
        
        This would print the message ```DATETIME - [INFO] Test 1,2``` in a nice looking purple with ```DATETIME``` replaced with the current timestamp.
        
        ![eg1](res/eg1.png?raw=true)
        
        <br>
        
        ##### The ```cthrow``` function
        
        The full ```cthrow``` function is as follows:
        ```Python
        cthrow(message, type='INFO', formatting=None, addPrefix=True, dateTime=True)
        ```
        
        ##### Setting the ```type``` argument
        
        As you can see, a flag can be specified. This specifies the colour of the message and the message type. When setting flags, ensure the strings match exactly the name of the flag detailed below.
         * INFO - A nice aesthetic purple message
         * OK - A satisfying green message
         * WARN - A cautionary yellow message
         * ERR - A not-so-good red message
        
        <br>
        
        For example:
        
        ```Python
        cthrow("This probably isn't good", type="WARN")
        ```
        
        ![eg2](res/eg2.png?raw=true)
        
        <br>
        
        ##### The ```addPrefix``` and ```dateTime``` arguments
        
        We can also disable the prefix (the stuff inside the []) and timestamp as follows.
        
        ```Python
        cthrow("Look Mom, no prefix and timestamp!", addPrefix=False, dateTime=False)
        ```
        
        <br>
        
        ##### Setting formatting flags
        
        With ThrowColour it is also possible to set multiple formatting flags such as bold and italics. It is important to note that the argument ```formatting``` takes a list containing strings of different formatting options.
        
        ```Python
        cthrow("Bold and Underlined", formatting=['BOLD','UNDERLINE'])
        ```
        ![eg3](res/eg3.png?raw=true)
        
        Or just bolded,
        ```Python
        cthrow("Nice and bold", formatting=['BOLD'])
        ```
        
        ![eg4](res/eg4.png?raw=true)
