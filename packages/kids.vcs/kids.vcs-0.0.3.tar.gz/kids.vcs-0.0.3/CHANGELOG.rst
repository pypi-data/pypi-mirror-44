    a ``GitTag`` of current commit thanks to its label.
  - GitCommit: support of ``<`` (less-than) operator to map as close as possible
    with order relation of commits given by command git log.
  - GitCommit: support of ``in`` (``.__contains__(..)``) operator to map with
    ancestor relationship.

    been removed. Please refer to documentation for more information.
