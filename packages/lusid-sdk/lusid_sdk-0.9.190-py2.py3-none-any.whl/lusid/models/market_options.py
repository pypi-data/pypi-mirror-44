class MarketOptions(Model):
    """The set of options that control miscellaneous and default market resolution
    behaviour.
    These are aimed at a 'crude' level of control for those who do not wish to
    fine tune the way that data is resolved.
    For clients who wish to simply match instruments to prices this is quite
    possibly sufficient. For those wishing to control market data sources
    according to requirements based on accuracy or timeliness it is not. In
    more advanced cases the options should largely be ignored and rules
    specified
    per source. Be aware that where no specified rule matches the final
    fallback is on to the logic implied here.

    :param default_supplier: The default supplier of data. This controls which
     'dialect' is used to find particular market data. e.g. one supplier might
     address data by RIC, another by PermId. Possible values include:
     'DataScope', 'Lusid'
    :type default_supplier: str or ~lusid.models.enum
    :param default_instrument_code_type: when instrument quotes are searched
     for, what identifier should be used by default. Possible values include:
     'LusidInstrumentId', 'Figi', 'RIC', 'QuotePermId', 'Isin', 'CurrencyPair'
    :type default_instrument_code_type: str or ~lusid.models.enum
    :param default_scope: for default rules, which scope should data be
     searched for in
    :type default_scope: str
