    """A market data key rule describes a mapping for satisfying a particular
    market dependency. The supplier, scope, quote type and price side
    information define the quote in the market and which Vendor for market data
    would be used to perform the lookup.
    The market data key defines what dependency this satisfies. The key is a
    rule that describes the asset class, its identifier and any other
    specifics required to uniquely describe a specific economic entity (e.g. an
    Fx currency pair, equity name or credit curve).

     separated string (A.B.C.D.*)
    :type key: str
    :param supplier: The market data supplier (where the data comes from).
     Possible values include: 'DataScope', 'Lusid'
    :type supplier: str or ~lusid.models.enum
    :param data_scope: The scope in which the data should be found when using
     this rule.
    :type data_scope: str
    :param quote_type: Is the quote to be looked for a price, yield etc.
     Possible values include: 'Price', 'Spread', 'Rate'
    :type quote_type: str or ~lusid.models.enum
    :param price_side: The conceptual qualification for the field. Something
     like Bid, Ask or Mid. Possible values include: 'Bid', 'Mid', 'Ask'
