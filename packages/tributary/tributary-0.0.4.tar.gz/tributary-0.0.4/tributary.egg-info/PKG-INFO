        # Stream Types
        Tributary offers several kinds of streams:
        
        ## Reactive
        These are synchronous, reactive data streams, built using python generators. They are designed to mimic complex event processors in terms of event ordering.
        
        ## Asynchronous
        These are synchronous, reactive data streams, built using asynchronous python generators. They are a variant of the reactive streams, but should offer performance improvements over the non-asynchronous variants. 
        
        ## Functional
        These are functional streams, built by currying python functions (callbacks). 
        
        ## Lazy
        These are lazily-evaluated python streams, where outputs are propogated only as inputs change.
        
        ## Event Loop
        These function as tornado based event-loop based streams similar to streamz.
