==============
Website Portal
==============

Backport (with adjustments) of the ``website_portal`` module of Odoo 9.

This module allows your customers to manage their account from the website
interface, without the need to access the client backend.

Usage
=====
Login, then click on your name on the right top menu and select "My Account"
You'll see a page with your details and a button to edit them without having to
go on the backend portal part of Odoo.

This module is particularly useful when external user registration is enabled.
(Settings -> General Settings -> Allow external users to sign up)
