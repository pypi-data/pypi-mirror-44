    "One of the main goals when designing ``Panel`` was that it should make it possible to seamlessly transition from interactively prototyping a dashboard in the notebook or on the commandline to deploying it as a standalone server app. This section will discover how to display panels interactively, embed static output, saving a snapshot and deploying it as a separate app.\n",

    "As you may have noticed almost all the ``Panel`` documentation is written using notebooks, ``Panel`` objects display themselves in the notebook and take advantage of Jupyter Comms to support communication between the rendered app and the Jupyter kernel backing it on the Python end. To display a panel object in the notebook is as simple as putting it on the end of a cell. Note however that the ``panel.extension`` has to be loaded to initialize the required Javascript and if you are working in JupyterLab the pyviz labextension has to be installed with:\n",

    "    jupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz\n",
