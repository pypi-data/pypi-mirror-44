        Python tools for solving problems related to soil liquefaction
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install liquepy

        ============
        
        How do I get set up?
        --------------------
        
        1. Run ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
        
        
        Code suggestions
        ----------------
        
        * Implementations of published liquefaction methods should be written as `calc_<property>_<first_author>[_et_al]_<date>()` for two authors include both.
        
        * Plotting and visualisation should be not included in computation objects. Instead plotting functions or objects should receive computation objects as inputs.
        
        Formatting
        ----------
        
        * Follow `pep8 formatting standard <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ (except for line character limit not strictly observed)
        
        * Docstrings written in `numpy format <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_
        
        * Tabulated data stored as comma separated or semi-colon separated files (not xlsx or xls)
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        Tests are run with pytest
        
        * Locally run: ``pytest`` on the command line.
        
        * Tests are run on every push using travis, see the ``.travis.yml`` file
        
        To test the docs:
        
        1. Install the check docs package: Run ``pip install collective.checkdocs``
        
        2. Run the check docs package and fix the errors: Run ``python setup.py checkdocs``
        
        
        Deployment
        ----------
        
        To deploy the package to pypi.com you need to:
        
         1. Push to the *pypi* branch. This executes the tests on circleci.com
        
         2. Create a git tag and push to github, run: ``trigger_deploy.py`` or manually:
        
         .. code:: bash
        
            git tag 0.5.2 -m "version 0.5.2"
            git push --tags origin pypi

        History
        =======
        
        0.5.1 (2018-03-29)
        -------------------
        
        * Added more correlations
        * Changed all calculation functions to start with the prefix 'calc'
        * Can set cut_time for obtaining strain compatible site response profile
        
        0.5.0 (2018-03-14)
        -------------------
        
        * Changed order of inputs in ElementTest object!
        * Changed ElementTest attributes (gamma -> strain, tau -> stress)
        
        0.4.12 (2018-03-14)
        -------------------
        
        * Added calculation of dissipated energy and cumulative absolute change in shear stress of element tests
        
        
        0.4.11 (2018-03-14)
        -------------------
        
        * Added plotting functions for CPT
        * Cleaned up names of input motion saving functions, and order of args
        
        0.4.8 - 0.4.10 (2018-03-08)
        ---------------------------
        
        * Updated docstrings, readme file
        * Fixed number of columns to load on CPT to be 0-3
        
        0.4.7 (2018-02-28)
        ------------------
        
        * `run_bi2014` fixed bug where water unit weight was 10 times too big
        
        0.4.5 (2018-02-27)
        ------------------
        
        * `BoulangerIdriss2014` unit weight calculation now uses the specific weight of water a gravity=9.8
        * `BoulangerIdriss2014` gwl now is the ground water level during the earthquake, while cpt_gwl is the gwl at cpt measure
        * Added `BoulangerIdriss2014CPT` which performs `BoulangerIdriss2014` but takes CPT as an input
        
        
        0.4.4 (2018-02-27)
        ------------------
        
        * Changes to `BoulangerIdriss2014`:
        
            * Added `big_q` as a property
            * Modified unit weight calculation (minimum changed from 15kN/m3 to 14.715kN/m3 (lowest value in original study by Roberston (2010)), Added maximum unit weight 19.62kN/m3 (maximum value in study),
            * Changed atmospheric pressure from 100kPa to 101kPa (also added as an optional input)
            * Input `magnitude` -> `m_w`
            * Added support for calculation of unit weight using specific weight
            * Optional input `s_g` to override specific weight of 2.65
            * Optional input `s_g_water` to override specific weight of water
