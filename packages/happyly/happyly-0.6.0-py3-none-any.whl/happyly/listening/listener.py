    Listener is a form of Executor
    which is able to run pipeline by an event coming from a subscription.

    Listener itself doesn't know how to subscribe,
    it subscribes via a provided subscriber.

    As any executor, implements managing of stages inside the pipeline
    (deserialization, handling, serialization, publishing)
    and contains callbacks between the stages which can be easily overridden.

    As any executor, listener does not implement stages themselves,
    it takes internal implementation of stages from corresponding components:
    handler, deserializer, publisher.

    It means that listener is universal
    and can work with any serialization/messaging technology
    depending on concrete components provided to listener's constructor.
