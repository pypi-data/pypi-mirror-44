0.2b1 (2011-11-19)
------------------
- Turn product into an egg and release on PyPI.

- Implement a forced refresh of the in-process cache of memcache data at the
  end of transactions to avoid stale data.

- mapping.py: Added 'getContainerKey' method to 'MemCacheMapping' in
  order to make it compatible with the API of the TemporaryFolder version
  (allows the session testing rig code can generate error messages).

- Added (preliminary) RAMCacheManager replacement.

- Removed  proxy's 'create' method, to allow other multiple of data to be
  stored.  The session data container now handles instantiating the
  mapping.

- Fixed the pickling of mappings *correctly*, instead of requiring that
  the proxy pick out the 'data' member.

- Expanded API for IProxy to expose more of the memcached client API.
