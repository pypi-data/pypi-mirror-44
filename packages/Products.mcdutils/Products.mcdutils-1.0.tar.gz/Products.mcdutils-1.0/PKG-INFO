        ===================
         Products.mcdutils
        ===================
        The `Products.mcdutils` product supplies a replacement for the ZODB-based
        session data container supplied by the `Transience` product, shipped with
        the Zope core prior to Zope 4 and available as a separate package after that.
        Rather than using a ZODB storage as the backing store for session data, as
        `Transience` does, `Products.mcdutils` stores session data in a cluster of
        one or more `memcached` servers.
        
        This approach is a bit of a cheat, as it uses the daemons as primary stores,
        rather than as caches for results of an expensive query.  Nevertheless, the
        semantics are not a bad match for typical session usage.

        Change log
        ==========
        
        1.0 (2019-03-28)
        ----------------
        - Zope 4 compatibility
        
        - documentation using Sphinx
        
        - ``tox`` configuration for unit, coverage and code quality tests
        
        - package configuration cleanup
        
        - full ``flake8`` compliance
        
        - add ability to set a title for a MemcacheProxy
        
        - add ability to set a title for a MemcacheSessionDataContainer
        
        
        0.2b3 (2011-11-21)
        ------------------
        - Extend MANIFEST.in to include other missing files (.gif, .pt, .txt)
        
        
        0.2b2 (2011-11-21)
        ------------------
        - Fix source distribution by including README.txt and CHANGES.txt via
          manifest.
        
        - Include test runner in buildout and fix broken tests.
        
        
        0.2b1 (2011-11-19)
        ------------------
        - Turn product into an egg and release on PyPI.
        
        - Implement a forced refresh of the in-process cache of memcache data at the
          end of transactions to avoid stale data.
        
        - mapping.py: Added 'getContainerKey' method to 'MemCacheMapping' in
          order to make it compatible with the API of the TemporaryFolder version
          (allows the session testing rig code can generate error messages).
        
        - Added (preliminary) RAMCacheManager replacement.
        
        - Removed  proxy's 'create' method, to allow other multiple of data to be
          stored.  The session data container now handles instantiating the
          mapping.
        
        - Fixed the pickling of mappings *correctly*, instead of requiring that
          the proxy pick out the 'data' member.
        
        - Expanded API for IProxy to expose more of the memcached client API.
        
        
        0.1 (2006-05-31)
        ----------------
        - CVS tag, 'mcdutils-0_1'
        
        - Initial public release.
