Description: Purge old files
        ===============
        
        Simple tool to delete old files using a set of contraints.
        
        If ``--include`` if used,
        only files matching the provided glob pattern are considered.
        This option can be used multiple times.
        By default, all files are considered.

              DIRECTORY             Directory or glob pattern to be scanned (multiple
                                    directories can be provided)

        FAQ
        ---
        
        * Do you know you can do this with a simple shell script using ``find``?
        
          Yep. I wrote those for years. They are also painful to maintain.
          And error prone. Feel free to use a shell script. :)
