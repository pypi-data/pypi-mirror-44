Description: epydemic: Epidemic simulations on networks in Python
        =====================================================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        ``epydemic`` is a Python library that implements simulations of epidemic
        (and other) processes over networks. Epidemic processes are very
        important in both network science and its applications. The most
        common application is to study the ways in which diseases progress in
        different network conditions, depending on their infectiousness and
        other properties.
        
        ``epydemic`` provides the basic simulation machinery for performing
        epidemic simulations under two different simulation regimes:
        synchronous simulation in which time proceeds in discrete time
        intervals, and stochastic or Gillespie simulations which are better
        for handling a wider range of probabilities (but which are slightly
        harder to specify).
        
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install ``epydemic`` directly from PyPi using ``pip``:
        
        ::
        
           pip install epydemic
        
        The master distribution of ``epydemic`` is hosted on GitHub. To obtain a
        copy, just clone the repo:
        
        ::
           
            git clone git@github.com:simoninireland/epydemic.git
            cd epydemic
            python setup.py install
        
        
           
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        API documentation for `epydemic` is available on `ReadTheDocs <https://pyepydemic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
        (please note the slightly different project name).
