==========================
Project Task Add Very High
==========================

This module extend the field `priority` in project tasks, adding a new level of priority.
This new level of priority is named `Very High`.

On a task form, the priority widget is shown as three stars instead of two:

.. figure:: static/description/image.png
   :alt: On form, priority widget shows three stars instead of two

Also on a kanban view, the priority widget is shown as three stars instead of two:

.. figure:: static/description/image2.png
   :alt: On kanban, priority widget shows three stars instead of two

Without having this module installed, it would look as that:

.. figure:: static/description/image_a.png
   :alt: On form, priority widget shows two stars

.. figure:: static/description/image2_a.png
   :alt: On kanban, priority widget shows two stars

In case this module is uninstalled, all the tasks that were previously set as `Very High` priority will be converted to `High` priority.

#. Open a task or create a new one
