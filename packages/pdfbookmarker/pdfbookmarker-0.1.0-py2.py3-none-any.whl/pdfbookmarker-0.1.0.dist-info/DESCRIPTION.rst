Add bookmarks to existing PDF files

Usage:
  $ pdfbm [options] <FILE.pdf> [FILE.txt] [FILE-new.pdf]

Options:
  -h, --help    show this help

Examples:
  $ pdfbm FILE.pdf  # will read FILE.pdf as PDF, FILE.txt as a
  bookmarks file and shall give the FILE-new.pdf as output.

Hence, parameters FILE.txt and FILE-new.pdf are optional, hah.
