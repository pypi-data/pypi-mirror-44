Build macOS wheels with Xcode 6.4, supporting older macOS versions
==================================================================

The macOS wheels for Pillow 5.1.0 were built with Xcode 9.2, meaning 10.12
Sierra was the lowest supported version.

Prior to Pillow 5.1.0, Xcode 8 was used, supporting El Capitan 10.11.

Instead, Pillow 5.1.1 is built with the oldest available Xcode 6.4 to support
at least 10.10 Yosemite.

Fix _i2f compilation on some GCC versions
=========================================

For example, this allows compilation on GCC 4.8.
