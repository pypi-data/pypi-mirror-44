# Unitable

Unitable is a data analysis environment that unites the best features of pandas, R, Stata, and others.
It is designed around the idea of a simple, global data frame that can be manipulated with minimal
code (a "universal table"), but with the extensibility and flexibility of the Python programming language
and the PyData suite (pandas, numpy, and scipy).

The initial prototype release is mainly focused on manipulating the universal table.
