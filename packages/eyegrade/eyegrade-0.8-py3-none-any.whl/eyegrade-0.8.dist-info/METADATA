[Eyegrade](https://www.eyegrade.org/)
uses a webcam to grade multiple choice question (MCQ) exams.
Needing just a cheap low-end webcam, it aims to be a low-cost
and portable solution available to everyone, on the contrary to other
solutions based on scanners.

The main features of Eyegrade are:

- Grading exams:
Using a webcam, the graphical user interface of
Eyegrade allows you to scan and grade your students' exams.
Eyegrade is able to recognize not only the answers to the questions,
but also the identity of the student
by using its hand-written digit recognition module.
The whole process is supervised by you so that you can detect
and fix any potential error of the image recognition system.

- Exporting grades:
Grades can be exported in
[Office Open XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML) format
(.XLSX files that can be read from Microsoft Excel
LibreOffice, Google Docs and other spreadsheet software)
as well as the
[CSV (comma-separated
values)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format.

- Typesetting exams: Although you can create your exams with other tools,
Eyegrade integrates an utility to creating MCQ exams. It is able to
create your exams in PDF format.  Eyegrade can automatically build
several versions of the exam by reordering questions and choices
within questions.
The [LaTeX document preparation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)
must be installed in your system in order to use this feature.
