# Change Log

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [1.1.0] - 2019-03-28
- Added a feature- and structure-preserving network reduction method for large-scale grids.

## [1.0.8] - 2019-02-26
- Added a setter for the grid name and description of a database (``DBConnection.grid_name`` and ``DBConnection.description``).
- Changed the default tolerance of the IPOPT QCQP solver to ``1e-6`` (was ``1e-7``).

## [1.0.7] - 2019-02-05
- Added average branch utilization statistics to the OPF summary.
- Added a local mode to the optimization server (replaces ``num_local_workers``).
- Added a marginal price property to the ``PWLFunction`` class.
- Changed the automatic solver selection to require a QCQP solver for systems without the *hybrid architecture*.

## [1.0.6] - 2019-01-10
- Fixed an issue in the MATPOWER import with optional data columns of the MATPOWER format.

## [1.0.5] - 2019-01-10
- Added ``Scenario.has_hybrid_architecture``, ``Scenario.get_ac_branches``, ``Scenario.get_dc_branches``, ``Scenario.add_compensator``, ``CapRegion.copy``, ``show_power_balance_error``, and ``show_branch_reconstruction_error``.
- Added an object-oriented design to the rank-1 approximation methods (to avoid the need of closures for their configuration).
- Added the detection of omitted ramping limits in the MATPOWER import.
- Extended the physical validity assessment that underlies ``OPFResult.is_physical``.
- Updated the automatic solver selection and OPF result summary with the consideration of the *hybrid architecture*.
- Changed the default rank-1 approximation to the graph traversal method.
- Removed ``SystemModel.is_acyclic``, ``SystemModel.ac_subgrids``, and ``SystemModel.dc_subgrids``.

## [1.0.4] - 2018-12-28
- Revised the constraint scaling to improve performance.

## [1.0.3] - 2018-12-11
- Extended the scenario verification to detect lines that connect buses with different base voltages.

## [1.0.2] - 2018-12-07
- Revised the management of worker processes to improve performance, especially under Windows.

## [1.0.1] - 2018-11-29
- Updated the README with solver installation instructions for Windows.
- Excluded support for CVXPY.

## [1.0.0] - 2018-11-27
- Official release.

## [0.9.9] - 2018-11-26
