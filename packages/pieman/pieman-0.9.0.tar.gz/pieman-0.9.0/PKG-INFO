        ======
        
        The package contains the utilities which are used by
        `Pieman <https://github.com/tolstoyevsky/pieman>`__, script for creating
        custom OS images for single-board computers. The utilities are:
        
        -  ``du.py``: provides the disk usage of the specified directory. It was
           developed primarily for estimating chroot environments disk usage. In
           some cases the utility provides more accurate result than ``du`` from
           GNU `coreutils <https://gnu.org/software/coreutils/>`__.
        -  ``image_attrs.py``: allows getting image attributes which are stored
           in the ``pieman.yml`` files. The utility is more high-level tool than
           `PyYAML <https://pyyaml.org>`__ because it's aware of the
           ``pieman.yml`` specifics.
