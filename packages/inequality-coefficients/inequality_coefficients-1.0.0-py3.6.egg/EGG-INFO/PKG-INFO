Description: Inequality Coefficients:
        =====================================================================
        
        This is small library with some implemented coefficients (or indices) intended
        to measure inequality or concentration of the values in a population.
        
        Implemented coefficients
        ------------
        - Gini Coefficient
        - Ratio top / rest
        
        Installation
        ------------
        This library is hosted on PyPI, so installation is straightforward. The easiest way to install type this at the command line (Linux, Mac, or Windows)::
        
            pip install inequality_coefficients
        
        This library also depends on numpy, but ``pip`` should take of that for you already.
        
        Basic Usage
        ------------
        For the simplest, typical use cases, this tells you everything you need to
        know.::
        
            import inequality_coefficients as ineq
            data = array([1.7, 3.2 ...]) # data can be list
            gini_coeff = ineq.gini_coeff(data)
            ratio_top_rest = ineq.ratio_top10_rest(data)
        
        
        Acknowledgements
        -----------------
        Many thanks to Felipe Ortega to open source his implementation of the Gini coefficient, available here: (https://github.com/ryanwitt/wikixray/blob/master/graphics.py).
        
        My code is based on that implementation, although I have made some changes and added a correction for small datasets based on [Deltas, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1162/rest.2003.85.1.226).
