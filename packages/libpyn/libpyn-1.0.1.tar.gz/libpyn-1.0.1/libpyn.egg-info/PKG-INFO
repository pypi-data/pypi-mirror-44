        ------------
        
        In order to install _libpyn_, run this command on the terminal
        
        ``` console
        foo@bar:~$ pip install libpyn
        ```

        Features
        --------
        
        * ### The Podcast class <a name="podcast-class"></a>
        
        The _Podcast class_ is the main feature of this package.
        
        ``` python
        # Import statement
        from libpyn.podcast import Podcast
        ```
        
        In order to create an instance of the Podcast class, pass a link to a _libsyn_ channel in with the instance declaration.
        
        ``` python
        channel = 'https://therabbithole.libsyn.com/'
        example = Podcast(channel)
        ```
        
        Once initialized, the Podcast class contains useful information about the podcast.
        
        ``` python
        example.name = # Name of the podcast channel
        self.mp3list = # List of episodes, each episode saved as a dictionary
        self.htmllink = # Link to the podcast's website  
        ```
        
        Each dictionary in _self.mp3list_ contains these key/value pairs:
        
        ``` python
        podcast = {}    # Dictionary for storing podcast info
        podcast['title'] = # Name of episode
        podcast['date'] = # Publish date
        podcast['mp3'] = # Link to mp3 file
        podcast['image'] = # Channel logo
        ```
        
        * ### Downloading podcasts
        
        In order to download the mp3 files of a podcast channel, use the **download()** function.
        
        ``` python
        # This will download the mp3 files in a directory named after the podcast channel
        # in the Downloads directory
        example.download()
        ```
        
        A specific _path_ can be specified, the name of the directory (_foldername_) in which the mp3 files will be stored can also be specified. If the foldername is not specified, it will be the name of the channel. (Spaces are replaced with underscores.)
        
        ``` python
        path = 'path/to/store/mp3'
        directory = '/files'
        example.download(path=path, foldername=directory)
        ```
        
        * ### iframes
        
        In order to get a list of HTML iframes of the latest episodes to embed on a webpage, use the **iframes()** function.
        
        ``` python
        iframesList = example.iframes()
        ```
