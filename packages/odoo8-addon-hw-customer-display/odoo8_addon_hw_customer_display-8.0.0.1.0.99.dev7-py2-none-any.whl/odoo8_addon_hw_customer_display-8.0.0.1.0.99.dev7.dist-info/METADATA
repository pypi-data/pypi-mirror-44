Hardware Customer Display
=========================

This module adds support for Customer Display in the Point of Sale.
This module is designed to be installed on the *POSbox* (i.e. the
proxy on which the USB devices are connected) and not on the main
Odoo server. On the main Odoo server, you should install the module
*pos_customer_display*.

The configuration of the hardware is done in the configuration file of
the Odoo server of the POSbox. You should add the following entries in
the configuration file:

* customer_display_device_name (default = /dev/ttyUSB0)
* customer_display_device_rate (default = 9600)
* customer_display_device_timeout (default = 2 seconds)

The number of cols of the Customer Display (usually 20) should be
configured on the main Odoo server, in the menu Point of Sale >
Configuration > Point of Sales. The number of rows is supposed to be 2.

It should support most serial and USB-serial LCD displays out-of-the-box
or with inheritance of a few functions.

It has been tested with:

* Bixolon BCD-1100 (Datasheet :
  http://www.bixolon.com/html/en/product/product_detail.xhtml?prod_id=61)
* Bixolon BCD-1000

To setup the BCD-1100 on Linux, you will find some technical instructions
on this page:

This module has been developped during a POS code sprint at Akretion
France from July 7th to July 10th 2014. This module is part of the POS
project of the Odoo Community Association http://odoo-community.org/.
You are invited to become a member and/or get involved in the
Association !
