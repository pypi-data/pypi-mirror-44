# pyfind
*A simple python import that will allow you to traverse local directories and sub-folders returning lists of files in folders.*

pyfind is under semi-active development as I am a student but this project *should* be maintained into the foreseeable future.

*Commands currently available:* `import pyfind as pf`
|Method|Documentation|
|--|--|
|*`find(location, extension, keepExtension)`*|Searches the current working directory (unless otherwise specified) for any files with the matching extension property and return them in array format.|
|**Still Under Development**|**Documentation**|
|*`findsub(location, extension, keepExtension)`*|Searches the chosen directory and all contained sub folders for any files with the matching extension property and return them in array format.|

These will be added whenever I get round to it

**To-do list**
 - [x] ~~find() method~~ 
 - [ ] findsub() method
 - [ ] recursive rewrite of methods
 - [ ] customisation of the output and saving this custom output format to a settings file (e.g. splitting using a csv, outputting as a new-line string instead of a list, etc.)
 - [ ] saving search results to an output log
 - [ ] allowing the instantiation of classes that can deal with:
	 - [ ] scheduled searches (based on time)
	 - [ ] searches that run when a method is called 
	 - [ ] saving these settings and schedules and loading them from files
