Description:

        BiLSTM + CRF for sequence tagging
        
        This is adapted from guillaumegenthial 's original implementation and is made configurable and easy to adapt and use.
        
        **Requirements:**
        
        This code is tested with all tensorflow versions from 1.3.0 to 1.10.0.
        
        tensorflow is not included in setup.py since, it will remove tensorflow-gpu.
        Separately install tensorflow by following https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ for this module to work.
        
        Download the 300 dimnesional glove vectors from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
        
        **Installation:**
        
        The stable version can be installed by running "pip install seqtag"
        
        **How to Use:**
        
        Create a training directory with train.txt and valid.txt (test.txt is optional)
        set the config parameters as expected in a configuration file. 
        
        An example of the configuration file can be found at https://github.com/bedapudi6788/seqtag/blob/master/example_config.json
        
        **Training:**
        
        from seqtag import trainer
        
        trainer.train(config_path = 'path_to_config_json')
        
        **Running Predictions:**
        
        from seqtag import predictor
        
        model = predictor.load_model(path_to_config.json)
        
        predictor.predict(model, ['I', 'am', 'Batman'])
        
        ['O', 'O', 'B-PER']
        
        For an usage example take a look at https://github.com/bedapudi6788/Deep-Segmentation/ . seqtag is used for sentence segmentation in this repo.
