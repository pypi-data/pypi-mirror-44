### NOTE - if you have not already, complete the setup in 'workspace/runners/cosma/setup' before continuing with this
### cosma pipeline script.

# Welcome to the Cosma pipeline runner. Hopefully, you're familiar with runners at this point, and have been using them
# with PyAutoCTI to model CTI on your laptop. If not, I'd recommend you get used to doing that, before trying to
# run PyAutoCTI on a super-computer. You need some familiarity with the software and before trying to model a large
# amount of charge injection imaging on a supercomputer!

# If you are ready, then let me take you through the Cosma runner. It is remarkably similar to the ordinary pipeline
# runners you're used to, however it makes a few changes for running jobs on cosma:

# 1) The data path is over-written to the path '/cosma5/data/durham/cosma_username/autocti/data' as opposed to the
#    workspace. As we saw in the setup, on cosma we don't store our data in our workspace.

# 2) The output path is over-written to the path '/cosma5/data/durham/cosma_username/autocti/output' as opposed to
#    the workspace. This is for the same reason as the data.

# Given your username is where your data is stored, you'll need to put your cosma username here.
cosma_username = 'pdtw24'

# The cosma path where the data and output are stored.
cosma_path = '/cosma5/data/autocti/'

# Get the relative path to the config files and output folder in our workspace.
workspace_path = '{}/../'.format(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))

# Use this path to explicitly set the config path, and override the output path with the Cosma path.
conf.instance = conf.Config(config_path=workspace_path + 'config', output_path=cosma_path + 'output')

# Lets take a look at a Cosma batch script, which can be found at 'workspace/runners/cosma/batch/pipeline_runner_cosma'.
# When we submit a PyAutoLens job to Cosma, we submit a 'batch' of jobs, whereby each job will run on one CPU of Cosma.
# Thus, if our lens sample contains, lets say, 4 lenses, we'd submit 4 jobs at the same time where each job applies
# our pipeline to each image.

# The fifth line of this batch script - '#SBATCH --array=1-4' is what species this. Its telling Cosma we're going to
# run 4 jobs, and the id's of those jobs will be numbered from 1 to 4. Infact, these ids are passed to this runner,
# and we'll use them to ensure that each jobs loads a different image. Lets get the cosma array id for our job.
batch_id = int(sys.argv[1])

# For a given COSMA run, we will assume all of the charge injection data-sets have identical properties. That is, they
# all have the same dimensions (shape), charge injection regions (ci_regions), charge injection normalizations
# (normalizations), charge injection patterns (patterns) and frame geometries defining the direction clocking and CTI
# (frame_geometry).

# If you need to change these value for a COSMA run, I recommend making a different runner script.
