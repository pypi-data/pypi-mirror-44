Logisitics budget
=================

This module adds a notion of budget on logistic requests and cost estimates.

A line of a logistic request can have a budget and a pre-approval by a budget
holder and a finance officer.

The creation of a cost estimate can be done without approval or with a budget
overrun. On the other hand, approving a cost estimate into a logistic order
requires approval by the budget holder, and the limit must be respected.
