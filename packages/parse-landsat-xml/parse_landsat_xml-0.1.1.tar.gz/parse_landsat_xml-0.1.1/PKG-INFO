Description: ## Parse Bulk Landsat Metadata
        
        USGS conveniently hosts a bulk metadata service located [here](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/bulk-metadata-service).
        
        Less conveniently, you get a large metadata file with no way to parse it.
        
        This project implements a CLI to parse the bulk metadata files and output .xml
        based on the user's search parameters. It also creates a .txt file with each Landsat sceneID
        for use with [EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). Users can search by date-range, cloud cover percentage, and 
        whether a lat/lon point is within the scene.
        
        
        A USGS EROS [account](https://ers.cr.usgs.gov/login/) is required if you want to download.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Flags:
        
        ```
        -f filename 
        -d YYYYMMDD_YYYYMMDD inclusive date range 
        -c max acceptable cloud cover in scene
        -b lat,lon boundary. the search only supports point based boundary.
        ```
        
        Example Usage:
        
        ```commandline
        cd /filepath/to/bulkmetadata
        parse_landsat_xml.py -f LANDSAT_8_C1.xml -d 20180101_20190101 -c 50 -b 12.114993-86.236176
