Description: # WatchMe
        
        ![docs/assets/img/logo_small.gif](docs/assets/img/logo_small.gif)
        
        Reproducible watching of web changes. Good for:
        
         1. Waiting for job postings to change or appear
         2. New content for blogs or personal sites that don't have email / rss / atom feeds
         
        WatchMe can watch for changes to an entire page, or a specific section of it.
        It's appropriate for research use cases where you want to track changes in one
        or more pages over time. Importantly, it's a reproducible setup, as your
        watches are stored in a configuration file that can easily be shared with others
        to reproduce your watching protocol.
        
        **under development**
