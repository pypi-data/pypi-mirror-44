        ## Features
        - Run gists directly from your bash. Multiple language support (python, ruby, shell, node)
        - Offline cache for gists
        
        
        ## Installation
        **ingi** assumes that any required binaries for executing gists are installed on your system, if not then it will fail.
        
        Install the cli tool through pip:
        ```
        pip install ingi-cli
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Invoking a gist
        ```
        ingi get https://api.github.com/gists/ac5a0fb49370e7cff3bee93ecc40b9a8
        ```
        or use the gist ID
        ```
        ingi get --use_id ac5a0fb49370e7cff3bee93ecc40b9a8
        ```
        
        You can also just cache the gist to use later
        ```
        ingi get --save_only --use_id ac5a0fb49370e7cff3bee93ecc40b9a8
        ```
        
        ## TODO & Improvements
        - Implementing a gist index to search gists programmatically. Any gists executed locally get automatically inserted and indexed on API to be used. 
        This will provide us with a rest API to search for gists &#x1F600;.
        
        - Configurable invoke queue, like an `invoke.yaml` which lists a bunch of gists to execute in order.
        
        - arguments to be passed to scripts, for e.g:
        ```
        ingi get --use_id ac5a0fb49370e7cff3bee93ecc40b9a8 first_arg second_arg
        ```
