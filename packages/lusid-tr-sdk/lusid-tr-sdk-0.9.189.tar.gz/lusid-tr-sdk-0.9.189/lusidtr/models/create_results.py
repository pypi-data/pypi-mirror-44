    :type scope: str
    :param key: The key is a unique point in 'run' space. For a given scope
     and time point, one would wish to
     identify a unique result set for a given recipe. In essence, this key is
     the unique identifier for the tuple (recipe,portfolios)
     However, that only matters when one is trying to use it automatically to
     retrieve them.
     A question becomes whether we would wish to store groups of protfolio
     results together, or only single ones.
     Also, whether we would accept uploading of groups and then split them
     apart.
