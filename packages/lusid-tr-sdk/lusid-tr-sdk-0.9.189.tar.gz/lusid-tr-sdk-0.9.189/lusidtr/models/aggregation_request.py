    """Specification object for the parameters of an aggregation.

    :param recipe_id: The configuration recipe, consisting of recipe scope and
     recipe name, to use in performing the aggregation.
    :type recipe_id: ~lusidtr.models.ResourceId
    :param inline_recipe: Target Method for providing a non-named recipe.
     If given, this replaces the 'RecipeId' used with the bespoke recipe. This
     is intended to allow use of non-named
     recipes to iterate quickly for design purposes. Ultimately it is
     recommended that production recipes would be stored
     in Lusid.
     USE OF ANY (INLINE) RECIPE IS AT PRESENT LIABLE TO CHANGE.
    :type inline_recipe: ~lusidtr.models.ConfigurationRecipe
    :param as_at: The asAt date to use
    :type as_at: datetime
    :param effective_at: The market data time, i.e. the time to run the
     aggregation request effective of.
    :type effective_at: datetime
    :param metrics: The set of specifications for items to calculate or
     retrieve during the aggregation and present in the results.
     This is logically equivalent to the set of operations in a Sql select
     statement
     select [operation1(field1), operation2(field2), ... ] from results
    :type metrics: list[~lusidtr.models.AggregateSpec]
    :param group_by: The set of items by which to perform grouping. This
     primarily matters when one or more of the metric operators is a mapping
     that reduces set size, e.g. sum or proportion. The group-by statement
     determines the set of keys by which to break the results out.
    :type group_by: list[str]
    :param filters: A set of filters to use to reduce the data found in a
     request. Equivalent to the 'where ...' part of a Sql select statement.
     For example, filter a set of values within a given range or matching a
     particular value.
    :type filters: list[~lusidtr.models.PropertyFilter]
    :param limit: limit the results to a particular number of values.
    :type limit: int
    :param sort: Sort the results or not.
