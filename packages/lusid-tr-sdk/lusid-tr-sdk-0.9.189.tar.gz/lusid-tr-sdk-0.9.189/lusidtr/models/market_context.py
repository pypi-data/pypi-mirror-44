    that require resolution of market data such as instrument prices or
    Fx rates. It controls where the data is loaded from and which sources take
    precedence.

     particular use cases. These can be relatively general or specific in
     nature.
     Nominally any number are possible and will be processed in order where
     applicable. However, there is evidently a potential
     for increased computational cost where many rules must be applied to
     resolve data. Ensuring that portfolios are structured in
     such a way as to reduce the number of rules required is therefore
     sensible.

     given asset class.

     simplest usage case, this is just a default supplier and instrument
     resolution code.
