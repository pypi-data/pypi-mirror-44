            Provide details of how the primary data (in the matrix) were generated. Include the name of the software used (e.g. Expression Console, Affymetrix Power Tools, other GeneChip Compatible software) and any normalization/scaling algorithms that were applied to the data (RMA, PLIER, etc). It is also appropriate to describe any secondary or tertiary analyses performed in this section (e.g. using GeneSpring, R, GeneBASE, etc). If the primary analysis was limited to a subset of the array probes (e.g. core probe sets only) please state so in this section.

            The name of the probe group file (.pgf) used in the primary analysis [e.g. MoEx-1_0-st-v1.r2.pgf]. We will use this information to determine/verfiy the correct GEO Platform for the submission.

            The name of the meta-probeset (.mps or .csv) file used in the primary analysis [e.g. HuEx-1_0-st-v2.r2.dt1.hg18.core.mps]. This file applies only to transcript/gene-level analyses. The genome build information in the file name is needed to determine/verify the GEO Platform for the submission.
