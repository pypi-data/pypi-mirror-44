      description: >
        For strand non-specific protocol, a read is considered overlapping
        with a feature regardless of whether it is mapped to the same or the
        opposite strand as the feature. For strand-specific forward protocol
        and single-end reads, the read has to be mapped to the same strand as
        the feature. For paired-end reads, the first read has to be on the
        same strand and the second read on the opposite strand. For
        strand-specific reverse protocol, these rules are reversed.
