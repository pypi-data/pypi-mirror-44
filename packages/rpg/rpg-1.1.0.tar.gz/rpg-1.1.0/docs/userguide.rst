Installation
============

From pip
--------

The suggested way of installing the latest **RPG** version is through **pip**:

.. code-block:: none

    pip3 install rpg

Then you can use:

.. code-block:: none

    rpg --help

From source code
----------------

**RPG** is coded in Python. To manually install it from source, get the source and install **RPG** using:

.. code-block:: none

    git clone https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/nmaillet/rpg/
    cd rpg
    python setup.py install

Using without installation
--------------------------

You can download the source code from Pasteur's **Gitlab**: https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/nmaillet/rpg/.

In order to directly run **RPG** from source, you need to copy file ``tests/context.py`` into ``rpg`` folder.

Then, uncomment line 42 of ``rpg/RapidePeptideGenerator.py``. Modify:

.. code-block:: python

    #from context import rpg

To:

.. code-block:: python

    from context import rpg

Then, from the main **RPG** directory, use:

.. code-block:: none

    python3 rpg/RapidPeptidesGenerator.py -\\-help

.. warning:: Using without installation is not recommended, as you need all requirements of `requirements.txt` installed locally and you may encounter issues with Sphinx autodoc or other unwanted behaviors.

To perform sequential digestion of the sequence "QWSDORESDF" with enzymes 2 and 5 and store results in `output_file.fasta`, use:

.. code-block:: none

    rpg -i QWSDORESDF -o output_file.fasta -e 2 5

Sequential digestion of a (multi)fasta file
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To perform sequential digestion of `input_file.fasta` with enzymes 2 and 5 and store results in `output_file.fasta`, use:

.. _digestion:

Digestion modes
===============

There are two digestion modes in **RPG**. In 'sequential' mode, each protein will be digested by each enzyme, one by one. Launching 3 times **RPG** on the same protein with 3 different enzymes or launching one time **RPG** on the protein with the 3 enzymes in 'sequential' mode leads to exactly the same result.

In concurrent mode, all enzymes are present at the same time during digestion and exposure time is supposed to be infinite, *i.e.* all possible cleavages **will** occur (there is no miscleavage). In this mode, the cleavage of a first enzyme can make available the cleavage site of another enzyme.

Let's define two enzymes. The first is called 'afterP' (id 28) and cleaves after P. The second is called 'afterK' (id 29) and cleaves after K if there is no P just before. Digesting 'PKPKPKPK' using those two enzymes in sequential mode gives the following result (see :ref:`formats` for more information):

.. code-block:: none

    $ rpg -i PKPKPKPK -e 28 29
    >Input_0_afterP_1_1_115.13198_5.54
    P
    >Input_1_afterP_3_2_243.30608_9.4
    KP
    >Input_2_afterP_5_2_243.30608_9.4
    KP
    >Input_3_afterP_7_2_243.30608_9.4
    KP
    >Input_4_afterP_8_1_146.18938_9.4
    K
    >Input_0_afterK_0_8_919.17848_11.27
    PKPKPKPK

'afterP' cleaves as expected and 'afterK' is not able to cleave anything.

Digesting 'PKPKPKPK' using those two enzymes in concurrent mode gives the following result:

.. code-block:: none

    $ rpg -i PKPKPKPK -e 28 29 -d c
    >Input_0_afterP-afterK_1_1_115.13198_5.54
    P
    >Input_1_afterP-afterK_2_1_146.18938_9.4
    K
    >Input_2_afterP-afterK_3_1_115.13198_5.54
    P
    >Input_3_afterP-afterK_4_1_146.18938_9.4
    K
    >Input_4_afterP-afterK_5_1_115.13198_5.54
    P
    >Input_5_afterP-afterK_6_1_146.18938_9.4
    K
    >Input_6_afterP-afterK_7_1_115.13198_5.54
    P
    >Input_7_afterP-afterK_8_1_146.18938_9.4
    K

Here, we have to understand that 'afterP' cleaves at the same positions as in sequential mode and the products (mostly 'KP') are then cleaved by 'afterK'. Indeed, there is no more P before K, making 'afterK' able to cleave.

Default mode is 'sequential'. Reminder: you can input miscleavage values only for this mode.


.. _miscleavage:

Miscleavage
===========

Sometimes an enzyme does not cleave at a given position even if requirements are fulfilled. This event is called miscleavage and can have biological, chemical or physical origins. To take into account this behavior in **RPG**, one can assign a miscleavage value to an enzyme, expressed as a **percentage**.

For example, using:

.. code-block:: none

    rpg -i QWSDORESDF -e 1 2 3 -m 1.4 2.6

will assign a miscleavage probability of `1.4%` to enzyme `1`, a miscleavage probability of `2.6%` to enzyme `2` and a miscleavage probability of `0%` to enzyme `3` (default behavior). For enzyme `1`, each cleavage will then have a probability of 0.014 to **not** occur.


.. _nointer:

Non-interactive mode
====================

Option **-n, -\\-noninteractive** force **RPG** to not print any standard output, only error(s) are displayed in the shell. It enable '-\\-quiet' option and overwrites -\\-verbose option. If output filename already exists, the output file will be systematically overwritten. This option is mostly used in cluster or pipeline when user does not want **RPG** to wait for input or display anything but errors.


.. _formats:

Output
======

Output of **RPG** contains the following information in one line for each generated peptide, in this order:

    - Header of original sequence or 'Input' if the sequence is directly inputed in **RPG**, *i.e.*, **-i** not used with a file
    - Sequential numbering (starting from 0) of out-coming peptides for each of original sequence
    - Enzyme name used to obtain this peptide
    - Cleavage position on the original sequence (0 if no cleavage occurs)
    - Peptide size
    - Peptide molecular weight estimation
    - Peptide isoelectric point estimation (pI)

Then, on the next line:

    - Peptide sequence

Peptide molecular weight approximation is computed as the addition of average isotopic masses of each amino acid present in the peptide. Then the average isotopic mass of one water molecule is added to it. Molecular weight values are given in Dalton (Da). It does not take into consideration any digestion-induced modifications.

The isoelectric point is computed by solving Henderson–Hasselbalch equation using binary search. It is based on Lukasz P. Kozlowski work (http://isoelectric.org/index.html).

The default output is in multi-fasta format. The header then summarizes all this information. For example, on the following multi-fasta result:

.. code-block:: none

    >Input_0_Asp-N_3_3_419.43738_5.54
    QWS
    >Input_1_Asp-N_8_5_742.78688_4.16
    ...

we can see that a sequence was directly inputed in **RPG** `(Input)`, the first peptide `(0)` was obtained with `Asp-N` and this enzyme cleaved after the `3rd` amino acid in the original sequence. The peptide has a size of `3` amino acids, a molecular weight estimated at `419.43738` Da and a theoretical isoelectric point of `5.54`. The full sequence is then written `(QWS)`. The output of the remaining peptides follows in the same format.

More information can be outputted using :ref:`verbose` option.


.. _random:

Random names
============

Option **-r, -\\-randomname** force **RPG** to use a random name for output file. When using it, **RPG** will not ask user output file name **nor location**. The output file will be created in the working directory. This option is generally used for testing or automatic tasks.


.. _verbose:

Verbosity
=========

Verbosity can be increased or decreased. The output file is not affected by **-v** or **-q** options.

With default verbosity level (no **-v** nor **-q** option), the output is:

.. code-block:: none

    $ rpg -i QWSDORESDF -e 1
    >Input_0_Asp-N_3_3_419.43738_5.54
    QWS
    >Input_1_Asp-N_8_5_742.78688_4.16
    DORES
    >Input_2_Asp-N_10_2_280.28048_3.6
    DF

Increasing verbosity by one, *i.e.* using **-v**, adds information about used options. For example:

.. code-block:: none

    $ rpg -i QWSDORESDF -e 1 -v
    Warning: File 'peptides.fasta' already exit!
    Overwrite it? (y/n)
    y
    Input: QWSDORESDF
    Enzyme(s) used: ['Asp-N']
    Mode: sequential
    miscleavage ratio: [0]
    Output file: /Users/nmaillet/Prog/RPG/peptides.fasta
    >Input_0_Asp-N_3_3_419.43738_5.54
    QWS
    >Input_1_Asp-N_8_5_742.78688_4.16
    DORES
    >Input_2_Asp-N_10_2_280.28048_3.6
    DF

Increasing verbosity by two, *i.e.* using **-vv**, also adds statistics about each of the digested proteins. For example:

.. code-block:: none

    $ rpg -i QWSDORESDF -e 1 -vv
    Warning: File 'peptides.fasta' already exit!
    Overwrite it? (y/n)
    y
    Input: QWSDORESDF
    Enzyme(s) used: ['Asp-N']
    Mode: sequential
    miscleavage ratio: [0]
    Output file: /Users/nmaillet/Prog/RPG/peptides.fasta

    Number of cleavage: 2
    Cleavage position: 3, 8
    Number of miscleavage: 0
    miscleavage position: 
    miscleavage ratio: 0.00%
    Smallest peptide size: 2
    N terminal peptide: QWS
    C terminal peptide: DF
    >Input_0_Asp-N_3_3_419.43738_5.54
    QWS
    >Input_1_Asp-N_8_5_742.78688_4.16
    DORES
    >Input_2_Asp-N_10_2_280.28048_3.6
    DF

Decreasing verbosity, *i.e.* using **-q** option, removes all information but errors. For example:

.. code-block:: none

    $ rpg -i QWSDORESDF -e 1 -q 
    Warning: File 'peptides.fasta' already exit!
    Overwrite it? (y/n)
    y


.. _addenzyme:

Creating a new enzyme
=====================

Option **-a, -\\-addenzyme** allows the user to define new enzymes. An enzyme contains one or several rules and exceptions.

In the following, nomenclature of `Schechter and Berger <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6035483>`_ is used. Amino acids before the cleavage site are designated as `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, etc in the N-terminal direction, and as `P1'`, `P2'`, `P3'`, etc in the C-terminal direction. For example, with cleavage site represented as '|':

.. code-block:: none

    ...P3-P2-P1-|-P1'-P2'-P3'...

In **RPG**, this nomenclature is represented as:

.. code-block:: none

    ...(P3)(P2)(P1)(,)(P1')(P2')(P3')...


Definition of rules
-------------------

A rule specifies which amino acid is targeted by the enzyme, the cleavage position (*i.e.* **before** or **after** the targeted amino acid) and optionally the surrounding context. Each amino acid must be included in parentheses, *i.e.* '**(**' and '**)**' and the cleavage position is represented by a comma, *i.e.* '**,**'. The comma must always be directly before or after an closing or opening parenthesis, respectively.

For example, to define a cleavage occurring **before** A, one must input:

.. code-block:: none

    (,A)

To define a cleavage occurring **after** B, one must input:

.. code-block:: none

    (B,)

The surrounding context is specified by adding other amino acids, before or after the targeted one. For example, to define a cleavage occurring **before** A, position `P1'`, preceded by B in position `P1`, C in position `P3` and followed by D in position `P2'`, one must input:

.. code-block:: none

    (C)()(B)(,A)(D)

Note that this enzyme will only cleave if it finds the motif C*BAD, where * could be **any** amino acid. It will **not** cleave BAD, nor C*BA, BA, etc. For example, creating and using enzyme `rpg_example_userguide` (enzyme id 43):

.. code-block:: none

    $ rpg -a    
    Name of the new enzyme?
    rpg_example_userguide
    Create a cleaving rule (c) or an exception (e)? (q) to quit:
    c
    Write your cleaving rule, (q) to quit:
    (C)()(B)(,A)(D)
    Create a cleaving rule (c) or an exception (e)? (q) to quit:
    q
    Add another enzyme? (y/n)
    n

    $ rpg -i CWBADE -e 43
    >Input_0_rpg_example_userguide_3_3_307.36728_5.46
    CWB
    >Input_1_rpg_example_userguide_6_3_333.29818_3.4
    ADE

    $ rpg -i FAD -e 43
    >Input_0_rpg_example_userguide_0_3_351.35928_3.6
    FAD


In order for this enzyme to also cleave before AD (before A in `P1'` followed by D in `P2'` ), on top of the previous rule, one has to define one more rule in **RPG**:

.. code-block:: none

    (,A)(D)
    (C)()(B)(,A)(D)

It is important to note that for each enzyme, it is enough that one of the rule is broken for the cleavage to not occur. In this example, the defined enzyme will **not** cleave BAD, as it is specified that it will cleave before A preceded by B in `P1` **if there is C in `P3`**. Identically, it will **not** cleave C*BA*, as D is required in `P2'` for both rules.


.. code-block:: none

    $rpg -a
    Name of the new enzyme?
    rpg_example_userguide

    Write your cleaving rule, (q) to quit:
    (C)()(B)(,A)(D)
    Create a cleaving rule (c) or an exception (e)? (q) to quit:
    q
    Add another enzyme? (y/n)
    n

    $ rpg -i CWBADE -e 43
    >Input_0_rpg_example_userguide_3_3_307.36728_5.46
    CWB
    >Input_1_rpg_example_userguide_6_3_333.29818_3.4
    ADE

    $ rpg -i FAD -e 43
    >Input_0_rpg_example_userguide_1_1_165.19188_5.54
    F
    >Input_1_rpg_example_userguide_3_2_204.18268_3.6
    AD

    $ rpg -i BAD -e 43
    >Input_0_rpg_example_userguide_0_3_204.18268_3.6
    BAD

The order of inputted rules is not relevant. In other words, this enzyme:

.. code-block:: none

    (,A)(D)
    (C)()(B)(,A)(D)

and this second one:

.. code-block:: none

    (C)()(B)(,A)(D)
    (,A)(D)

are identical.

It is possible to define none-related cleavage rules for the same enzyme, for example:

.. code-block:: none

    (G,)(G)
    (P)(W,)(E)(T)

This enzyme will cleave after G (position `P1`) followed by G in `P1'` and also after W (`P1`) preceded by P in `P2` and followed by E in `P1'` and T in `P2'`.

Note that each rule must concern only **one** cleavage site. It is not possible to input rule like:

.. code-block:: none

    (A,)(B,)

This would define an enzyme cleaving after A in `P1` followed by B in `P1'` but also cleaving after B in `P1` preceded by A in `P2`. The proper way to input this is by using two separate rules:

.. code-block:: none

    (A,)(B)
    (A)(B,)

However, it is possible to write rules in a more efficient way as explained in :ref:`easy`.


Definition of exceptions
------------------------

An exception specifies when a cleavage should **not** occur. **Exceptions must always be linked to a rule**.

For example, to define a cleavage occurring **before** A (`P1'` ), one must input:

.. code-block:: none

    (,A)

Exceptions can then be inputted. For example, to define "a cleavage occurs before A, except when P is in `P2'` ", the following exception needs to be added:

.. code-block:: none

    (,A)(P)

This enzyme will always cleave before A when not followed by P:

.. code-block:: none

    rpg -a

    e
    Write your exception rule, (q) to quit:

    >Input_0_rpg_example_userguide_0_6_604.67828_3.6
    CWBAPE

It is possible to input complex exceptions. For the previous enzyme, we can add the following exception:

.. code-block:: none

    (G)(T)()(,A)()(F)

This enzyme will always cleave before A (`P1'` ) when not followed by P (`P2'` ) or preceded by G in `P3`, T in `P2`, by any amino acid in `P1` and `P2'`, and F in `P3'` **at the same time**:

.. code-block:: none

It is important to understand that an exception should always be linked to a rule. If one inputs this rule:

.. code-block:: none

    (A,)

followed by this exception:

.. code-block:: none

    (B,)(C)

the exception will not be taken into account. This enzyme will just always cleave after A.



.. _easy:

Easily writing complex enzymes
------------------------------

To make enzyme creation easier to use, two tricks are available.

The first one simplifies the definition of enzymes cleaving **before** and **after** a given amino acid. Defining an enzyme cleaving, for example, before **and** after A, can be done with two rules:

.. code-block:: none

    (,A)
    (A,)

or simply using:

.. code-block:: none

    (,A,)

The second trick is the use of the keyword `or`. This allows multiple possibilities for on position. For example:

.. code-block:: none

    (,A or B)

is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: none

    (,A)
    (,B)

.. warning:: do not input ``(,A or ,B)``, as a comma must always directly preceding or following a parenthesis.

Those two tricks help on complex enzymes. For example, :ref:`peps13` preferentially cleaves around F or L, sometimes before, sometimes after, depending on the context. More specifically, it will not cleave before F or L in `P1'` followed by P in `P2'`. It will not cleave before F or L in `P1'` preceded by R in `P1` or P in `P2` or H/K/R in `P3`. It will not cleave after F or L in `P1` followed by P in `P2'`. And it will not cleave after F or L in `P1` preceded by P in `P2` or H/K/R in `P3`.

It can be defined either by:

.. code-block:: none

    cleaving rules:

    (F,)
    (L,)
    (,F)
    (,L)

    exception rules:

    (,F)(P)
    (,L)(P)
    (R)(,F)
    (R)(,L)
    (P)()(,F)
    (P)()(,L)
    (H)()()(,F)
    (K)()()(,F)
    (R)()()(,F)
    (H)()()(,L)
    (K)()()(,L)
    (R)()()(,L)
    (F,)()(P)
    (L,)()(P)
    (P)(F,)
    (P)(L,)
    (H)()(F,)
    (K)()(F,)
    (R)()(F,)
    (H)()(L,)
    (K)()(L,)
    (R)()(L,)

or, in a condensed way:

.. code-block:: none

    cleaving rule:

    (,F or L,)

    exception rules:

    (,F or L)(P)
    (R)(,F or L)
    (P)()(,F or L)
    (H or K or R)()()(,F or L)
    (F or L,)()(P)
    (P)(F or L,)
    (H or K or R)()(F or L,)

Those two definitions are completely equivalent for **RPG**.


Example of enzymes
------------------

All available enzymes are in :ref:`enzymes`, including their **RPG**'s definition.



Deleting user-defined enzymes
=============================

All user-defined enzymes are stored in ``~/rpg_user.py``. This file is automatically generated by **RPG** and written in **Python**.

Each enzyme definition starts with:

.. code-block:: python

    # User-defined enzyme <name of the enzyme>

and finishes with:

.. code-block:: python

    CPT_ENZ += 1

followed by 3 blank line.

To remove an enzyme, be sure to backup the file **before** any modifications. Then just remove the whole Python code of the enzyme, including the above-mentioned lines. Do not do any other modifications, as this code is used in **RPG** and any wrong modifications will make the software unable to run.

To remove all user-defined enzymes, just delete ``~/rpg_user.py`` file. It will be created again (empty) at the next launch of **RPG**.

Obviously, all deleted enzymes can not be recovered. If one wants to use them again they will need to be redefined in **RPG**, using -a option.
