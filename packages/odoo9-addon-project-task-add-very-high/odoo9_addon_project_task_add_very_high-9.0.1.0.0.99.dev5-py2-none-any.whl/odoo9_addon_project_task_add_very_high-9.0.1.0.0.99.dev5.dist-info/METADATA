==========================
Project Task Add Very High
==========================

This module extend the field `priority` in project tasks, adding a new level of priority.
This new level of priority is named `Very High`.

On a task form, the priority widget is shown as two stars instead of one:

.. figure:: static/description/image.png
   :alt: On form, priority widget shows two stars instead of one

Also on a kanban view, the priority widget is shown as two stars instead of one:

.. figure:: static/description/image2.png
   :alt: On kanban, priority widget shows two stars instead of one

Without having this module installed, it would look as that:

.. figure:: static/description/image_a.png
   :alt: On form, priority widget shows one star

.. figure:: static/description/image2_a.png
   :alt: On kanban, priority widget shows one star

In case this module is uninstalled, all the tasks that were previously set as `Very High` priority will be converted to `High` priority.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Open a task or create a new one
#. On the priority widget, two stars are displayed (instead of one)
#. Click on the second star: the priority of this task is now set to `Very High`
