3.1.0 - 2019-03-25
-------------------- 
Release of the `Points Of Interest API <https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/210/api-doc/55>`_

The Points Of Interest API, powered by AVUXI TopPlace, is a search API that returns a list of popular places for a particular location. The location can be defined as area bound by four coordinates or as a geographical coordinate with a radius. The popularity of a place or 'point of interest' is determined by AVUXI's proprietary algorithm that considers factors such as ratings, check-ins, category scores among other factors from a host of online media sources.
