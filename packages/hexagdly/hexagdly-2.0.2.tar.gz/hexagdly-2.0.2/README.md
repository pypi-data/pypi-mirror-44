# HexagDLy

HexagDLy is a Python-library extending the PyTorch deep learning framework with convolution and pooling operations on hexagonal grids. It can be used to build convolutional neural networks for applications that rely on hexagonally sampled data. More information is avialable on [GitHub](https://github.com/ai4iacts/hexagdly "HexagDLy - Project Page")
