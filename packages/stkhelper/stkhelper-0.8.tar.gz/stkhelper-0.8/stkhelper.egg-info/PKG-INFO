Description: stkhelper - for easy python integration with STK
        
        Purpose:
            This package was created as a bridge between a user and the STK Interface.
            The stkhelper package allows you to easily make scenarios and add
            satellites and area targets.
            
        Usage:
            To use stkhelper, you must have a license for STK that is above the free
            beginner license and allows for integration. As it stands, the package only
            works on Windows, but will hopefully work on Mac OS in the future.
