Description: # fuzzylab
        Python Fuzzy Logic library based on Octave fuzzy-logic-toolkit
        
        The way to use the fuzzylab functions is based on Matlab R2018b Fuzzy Logic Toolbox functions.
        
        ## Install
        
        ```
        pip install -U fuzzylab
        ```
        
        ## Use
        
        In the folder [notebooks](https://github.com/ITTcs/fuzzylab/tree/master/notebooks) exists notebook examples, for a starting point to the library.
        
        In all the notebooks it is initialized installing the fuzzylab library with 
        
        ```
        !pip install -U fuzzylab
        ```
        
        that use `!` for execute terminal commands in the cell.
        
        For plot in the notebook with the matplotlib library it is necessary to specify it with
        
        ```
        %matplotlib inline
        ```
        
        Now you can import the fuzzy library with
        
        ```
        from fuzzylab import *
        ```
        
        ## Example
        
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from fuzzylab import *
        
        x = np.linspace(0, 10, 101)
        y = trimf(x, [3, 6, 8])
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('trimf, P = [3, 6, 8]')
        show()
        ```
        
        ![trimf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ITTcs/fuzzylab/master/images/trimf.png)
