# gif2numpy
Python library to convert gif images to numpy images or to OpenCV without PIL or pillow. OpenCV does not support gif images.

Install it with 

    setup.py install
    
or with

    pip install gif2numpy
    
# Usage

You can use the library this way:

    from __future__ import print_function

    import gif2numpy

    import cv2
    
    images = "Images/audrey.gif", "Images/hopper.gif", "Images/testcolors.gif"

	for image in images:

	    np_image = gif2numpy.convert(image)

	    print("type of image:", image, type(np_image))

	    cv2.imshow("np_image", np_image)
        
	    cv2.waitKey()
        
There is also the class Gif inside the module which can be used to determine Gif features inside the image.
This is just the first beta version of the module - no support on special gif features or much testing has been done yet.

# TO DO:

Write more convenient function wrappers to deliver the Gif features of an image.

# Dependencies

You need to install cv2 (opencv-python), numpy, kaitaistruct by:

    pip install opencv-python numpy kaitaistruct
