Upload API
=========

### Class for working with Content Upload API.

You may use the Content Upload endpoint to upload documents for analysis.
In the past, users have uploaded survey responses, proprietary content,
and other types of data not available in the Crimson Hexagon data library.
To use this endpoint, please contact support and they will create a new custom content type for you. [Reference](https://apidocs.crimsonhexagon.com/reference#content-upload-1)
