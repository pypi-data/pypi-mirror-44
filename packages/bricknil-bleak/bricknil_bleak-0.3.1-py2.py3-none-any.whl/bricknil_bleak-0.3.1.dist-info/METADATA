** This is a fork of the original Bleak_ library ** by Henrik Blidh, with some modifications
to support my needs for my BrickNil_ project.  It has been packaged up for distribution with
that project on PyPI.   All credit to Henrik for his development of this wonderful asyncio package.

Also credit is due to David Lechner for his work on getting Windows 10 support working.

Bleak is an acronym for Bluetooth Low Energy platform Agnostic Klient.

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://bleak.readthedocs.io.

Bleak is a GATT client software, capable of connecting to BLE devices
acting as GATT servers. It is designed to provide a asynchronous,
cross-platform Python API to connect and communicate with e.g. sensors.

**Be warned: Bleak is still in an early state of implementation.**

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install bleak

Features
--------

* Supports Windows 10, version 16299 (Fall Creators Update)
* Supports Linux distributions with BlueZ >= 5.43
* Plans on macOS support via Core Bluetooth API (see `develop` branch for progress)

Bleak supports reading, writing and getting notifications from
GATT servers, as well as a function for discovering BLE devices.

Usage
-----

To discover Bluetooth devices that can be connected to:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    from bleak import discover

    async def run():
        devices = await discover()
        for d in devices:
            print(d)

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(run())


Connect to a Bluetooth device and read its model number:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    from bleak import BleakClient

    address = "24:71:89:cc:09:05"
    MODEL_NBR_UUID = "00002a24-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"

    async def run(address, loop):
        async with BleakClient(address, loop=loop) as client:
            model_number = await client.read_gatt_char(MODEL_NBR_UUID)
            print("Model Number: {0}".format("".join(map(chr, model_number))))

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(run(address, loop))
