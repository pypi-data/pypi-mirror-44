Django Agenda
=============

|pipeline-badge| |coverage-badge| |pypi-badge|

Django agenda is a django app that allow you to create and book
times in a schedule. Our goal is to handle all the nasty details for
you; like timezones, schedule changes, and whether or not a
specific segment is actually available to be booked.

Installation
------------

First, install via pip (on Windows, replace ``pip3`` with ``pip``)

::

    pip3 install django-agenda

Then, edit your ``settings.py``, adding this line to ``INSTALLED_APPS``

::

   'django_agenda',

Features
--------

* Create recurring availabilities. We should support everything that
  RFC 2445 does.
* Subclass AbstractBooking to create bookings. Bookings will reserve
  time slots, and flag them as busy.
* Uses dynamic foreign keys, so you can relate your availabilities &
  bookings to anything (a user, an office space, a classroom)

CHANGES
=======

0.6.3
-----

* Add `django_agenda.version`, drop pbr

0.6.2
-----

* add a related name for the bookings relation

0.6.1
-----

* Bug fix for case where foreign key wasn't called schedule

0.6.0
-----

A major rewrite & simplification. This version works *very* differently
from 0.5, don't expect to migrate easily.

* Time slots are now primarily for marking busy state, and
  availability occurrences are for free times.
* You have to create your own models, subclassing the abstract
  models in django_agenda.models. The good thing about this is
  that this allows us to use real foreign keys instead of
  generic ones.
* To that end, you'll have to migrate the data into your models.
  Django Agenda won't delete any of it's own models, but you'll
  have to migrate the data into the new models that you make.
* Booking validation is now done in AbstractBooking.clean
  instead of AbstractBooking.save. Make sure you call full_clean!
* You can use django_agenda.models.get_free_times to find all the
  free time spans in a particular space of time.

0.5.4
-----

* Add the ability to overlap busy slots

0.5.3
-----

* Add ability to overlap bookings

0.5.2
-----

* Add support for django 2

0.5.1
----`-

* Fix bug if the start/end time weren't in the same zone as the availability

0.5.0
-----

* Fix handling of daylight savings

GNU Lesser General Public License
=================================

*Version 3, 29 June 2007*
*Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc* <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

* **a)** under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

* **b)** under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
this License applicable to that copy.

### 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

* **a)** Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
covered by this License.
* **b)** Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

* **a)** Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
  covered by this License.

* **b)** Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
  document.

* **c)** For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
  execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
  these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
  copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

* **d)** Do one of the following:

  - **0)** Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
    License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
    suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
    recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
    the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
    manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
    Corresponding Source.
  - **1)** Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that **(a)** uses at run time
    a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
    system, and **(b)** will operate properly with a modified version
    of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
    Version.

* **e)** Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
  be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
  GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
  necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
  Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
  Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
  you use option **4d0**, the Installation Information must accompany
  the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
  Code. If you use option **4d1**, you must provide the Installation
  Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
  for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

* **a)** Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
  on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
  conveyed under the terms of this License.
* **b)** Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
  is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
  accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.
