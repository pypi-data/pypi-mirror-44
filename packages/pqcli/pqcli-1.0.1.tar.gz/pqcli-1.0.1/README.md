## How to install

If you have Python 3.7, just run `pip install --user pqcli` and you're good to go!
Then type `pqcli` to run the game.

In case if you want to use the git version, the process is just a little bit
more complex:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/rr-/pq-cli.git
$ cd pq-cli
$ pip install --user .
```
