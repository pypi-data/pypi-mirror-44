Description: # BrewBlox Service for the Tilt Hydrometer
        
        **This service is work in progress and is not currently functional**
        
        The [Tilt hydrometer](https://tilthydrometer.com/) is a wireless hydrometer and thermometer used to gather live readings of specific gravity and temperature when brewing beer.
        
        [Brewblox](https://brewpi.com/) is a modular brewery control system design to work with the BrewPi controller.
        
        This brewblox service integrates the Tilt hydrometer into Brewblox.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Deploy the Tilt service on the BrewBlox stack
        
        You need to add the service to your existing BrewBlox docker compose file.
        
        ```yaml
        tilt:
            image: j616s/brewblox-tilt:rpi-latest
            restart: unless-stopped
            privileged: true
            depends_on:
                - history
            labels:
                - "traefik.port=5000"
                - "traefik.frontend.rule=PathPrefix: /tilt"
            network_mode: host
        ```
        
        The brewblox-tilt docker images are available on docker hub.
        
        Note that the image tag to use is:
        
        -   rpi-latest for the arm architecture (when deploying on a RaspberryPi)
        -   latest for the amd architecture
        
        ### Add to your graphs
        
        Once the Tilt service receives data from your Tilt(s), it should be available as graph metrics in brewblox.
        
        ## TODO
        
        -   Allow calibration of temperature and SG values
