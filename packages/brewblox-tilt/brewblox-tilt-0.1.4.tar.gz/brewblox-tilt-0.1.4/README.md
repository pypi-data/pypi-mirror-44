# BrewBlox Service for the Tilt Hydrometer

The [Tilt hydrometer](https://tilthydrometer.com/) is a wireless hydrometer and thermometer used to gather live readings of specific gravity and temperature when brewing beer.

[Brewblox](https://brewpi.com/) is a modular brewery control system design to work with the BrewPi controller.

This brewblox service integrates the Tilt hydrometer into Brewblox.
