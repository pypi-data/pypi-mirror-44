Description: # Clea
        
        This project is an XML front matter metadata reader for documents
        that *almost* follows the [SciELO Publishing Schema],
        extracting and sanitizing the values regarding the affiliations.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Installation with minimal requirements,
        intended for use within Python, as an imported package:
        
        ```
        pip install scielo-clea
        ```
        
        Installation for use as a server (mainly for testing):
        
        ```
        pip install scielo-clea[server]
        ```
        
        
        ## Running the testing server
        
        You can run the development server using the flask CLI.
        For example, for listening at 8080 from every host:
        
        ```
        FLASK_APP=clea.server flask run -h 0.0.0.0 -p 8080
        ```
        
        In a production server with 4 worker processes for handling requests,
        you can, for example:
        
        - Install gunicorn (it's not a dependency)
        - Run `gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8080 -w 4 clea.server:app`
        
        
        ## Clea as a library
        
        A simple example to see all the extracted data is:
        
        ```python
        from clea.core import Article
        from pprint import pprint
        
        art = Article("some_file.xml")
        pprint(art.data_full)
        ```
        
        That's a dictionary of lists with all the "raw" extracted data.
        Using `art.data` instead of `art.data_full` should get the first item
        of the lists, or an empty string if it's empty
        (the same applies to branches and sub-articles).
        
        More simple stuff that can be done:
        
        ```python
        len(art.aff)              # Number of <aff> entries
        len(art.sub_article)      # Number of <sub-article>
        art.contrib[0].data_full  # Data from the first contributor as a dict
        
        # Something like {"type": "translation", "lang": "en"},
        # the content from <sub-article> attributes
        art.sub_article[0].article[0].data
        ```
        
        The extracted information is not exhaustive!
        Its result should not be seen as a replacement of the raw XML.
        
        One of the goals of this library was
        to help on creating a tabular data from a given XML
        with as many rows as required
        to have a pair of a matching `<aff>` and `<contrib>` in each row.
        These are the functions that does that matching:
        
        * `clea.join.aff_contrib_inner_gen(article)`
        * `clea.join.aff_contrib_full_gen(article)`
        * `clea.join.aff_contrib_inner(article)`
        * `clea.join.aff_contrib_full(article)`
        
        The ones with the `_gen` suffix are generator functions
        that yields a tuple with two `Branch` entries (or `None`),
        the other ones return a list of merged dictionaries
        in an almost tabular format (dictionary of lists of strings).
        Each list regarding these elements for these specific elements
        should usually have at most one string,
        but that's not always the case even for these specific elements,
        then one should be careful when using the `data` property.
        
        The `inner` and `full` in the names
        regards to `INNER JOIN` and `FULL OUTER JOIN` from SQL,
        meaning the unmatched elements
        (all `<aff>` and `<contrib>` unreferred nodes)
        are discarded in the former strategy,
        whereas they're forcefully matched with `None` in the latter.
        
        To print all the extracted data from a XML
        including both the `INNER JOIN` and `FULL OUTER JOIN`
        of matching `<aff>` and `<contrib>` pairs,
        similar to the test server response:
        
        ```python
        from clea.join import aff_contrib_inner, aff_contrib_full
        
        pprint({**article.data_full,
            "aff_contrib_full": aff_contrib_full(article),
            "aff_contrib_inner": aff_contrib_inner(article),
        })
        ```
