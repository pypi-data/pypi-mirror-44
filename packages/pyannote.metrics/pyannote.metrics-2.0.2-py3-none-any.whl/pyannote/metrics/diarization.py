    First, the optimal mapping between reference and hypothesis labels
    is obtained using the Hungarian algorithm. Then, the actual diarization
    error rate is computed as the identification error rate with each hypothesis
    label translated into the corresponding reference label.

    Parameters
    ----------
    collar : float, optional
        Duration (in seconds) of collars removed from evaluation around
        boundaries of reference segments.
    skip_overlap : bool, optional
        Set to True to not evaluate overlap regions.
        Defaults to False (i.e. keep overlap regions).
