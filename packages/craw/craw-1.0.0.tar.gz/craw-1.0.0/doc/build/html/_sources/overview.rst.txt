overview
========

**C**\ounter **R**\N\ **A** seq **W**\indow is a package which aim to compute and visualize the coverage
of RNA seq experiment.

The craw package contains two scripts `craw_coverage` and `craw_htmp`.
`craw_coverage` compute the coverage, whereas `craw_htmp` allow to represent graphically the results
of `craw_coverage` with a heat map.


craw_coverage
=============

`craw_coverage` take as input a bam file or wig file and an annotation file.
**The annotation file** describe on which gene the craw_coverage must compute the coverage.
The script compute a coverage for each position of this gene on a specified window
around a position of reference on both sense and put the results on a matrix.
The region of interest can be fixed for all genes (specified by the command line)
or variable. In the this case the annotation file must contains two columns to specify
beginning and the end of the region to take in account.
The results in the matrix are centered on the position of reference of each gene.
In the case of variable length of window the results are padded on left and right if necessary with
`None` value.
The results is saved in a file as a tabulated separated value by default with the same name as the bam file
with the `.cov` extension (see :ref:`cov_out` for more details).

Below an example to illustrate how craw_coverage work.
If we consider the following genome and we want to analyze 3 gene *foo*, *bar*, *buz*

.. image:: _static/genome.png
   :width: 40%
   :alt: genome

On the figure above

* The first line represent the positions on the genome (1-based)

       * The bold position indicate the boundaries of region we want to analyse.
       * the red highlighted positions indicate, for each region, the position of reference.

* the second line represent the genes and their respective sense.
* the 2 last lines the coverage at each position of the genome for each strand


So to analyse these genes, we create an annotation file like following.

.. image:: _static/annotation_file.png
   :width: 30%
   :alt: annotation

the run a command line like::

   craw_coverage --bam mygenome.bam --annot my_annotation --ref-col ref --start-col start --stop-col stop

will produce the following coverage matrix

.. image:: _static/coverage_matrix.png
   :width: 30%
   :alt: coverage matrix



craw_htmp
=========

`craw_htmp` read coverage file produced by `craw_coverage` and generate a graphical representation.
It can produce either a file or an interactive graphic. The look and feel of the graphic and the format
of supported outputs vary in function of the backend of matplotlib used (see :ref:`matplotlibrc` ).
It can also produce raw images using pillow where 1 nucleotide is represent by 1 pixel.
