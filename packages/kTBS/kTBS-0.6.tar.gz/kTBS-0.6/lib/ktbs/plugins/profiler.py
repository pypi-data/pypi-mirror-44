"""
This kTBS plugin allows to run the profiler on a per-request basis.

To enable the profiler, simply add 'profiler' as a URL parameter.

It will generate a temporary file named with the datetime and the URL,
which you can view with bin/view-profiler-dat, or a tool like
https://github.com/pwaller/pyprof2calltree.


Note that the profiler does not run the exact same code as the normal code:
it converts to a list the iterable returned by the WSGI application,
to ensure that all the code is actually ran in the profiler
(rather than differed by a generator).
