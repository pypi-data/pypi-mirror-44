"""
I define a registry of wrapper classes augmenting it cores.

While REST resource provide a `uniform interface <.cores.ICore>`:class:,
it is often useful to augment this interface with additional methods. In order
to respect the REST philosophy, those methods must not extend the uniform
interface, but merely provide *shortcuts* above it. In other word, they can all
be implemented by **wrapping** the uniform interface.

In this implementation, wrappers are implemented as *mix-in* classes relying
of `.cores.ICore`:class:, *e.g.*:

* a class inheriting `.cores.ICore`:class: (or another wrapper),
* defining no ``__init__`` method or internal state,
* with its methods using the methods defined in `.cores.ICore`:class:.

Such classes can then be "mixed in" any class implementing the core interface,
and augment their behaviour independantly of their underlying implementation.

The wrapper registry aims at being a central repository of such mix-in classes;
wrappers but be registered with :func:`register_wrapper`.
Functions :func:`get_wrapped` can then be used to build subclasses of a given
core implementation. This is useful to implement :meth:`.cores.ICore.factory`
and :func:`.cores.factory.factory`.
