"""I provide a general core factory.

While :meth:`ICore.factory <rdfrest.interface.ICore.factory>` aims at
producing a resource of the *same kind* as the target, it may be necessary, in
some cases, to navigate a link to a resource of another kind:

  * from a local resource to a remote one
  * from a remote resource to a local one
  * from a local resource to a local resource handled by another service
  * from a remote resource to a remote one using a different protocol

For this, this module provides its own :func:`factory` function.

.. autofunction:: factory

But this function needs to know all the implementations of
:class:`.interface.ICore` and all implemented
`services <.local.Service>`:class:. This is what :func:`register_implementation`
and :func:`register_service` are about, respectively.

.. autofunction:: register_implementation

.. autofunction:: register_service

.. autofunction:: unregister_service

Note that this module automatically registers all the implementations shipped
with rdfrest; furthermore, :class:`.local.Service` automatically registers all
its instances. However, you should check before you call :func:`factory` that:

  * all the external implementations have been registered (this is usually done
    by simply importing them, as :meth:`register_implementation` is meant to be
    used as a class decorator);
  * all the services you rely on have been instanciated.
