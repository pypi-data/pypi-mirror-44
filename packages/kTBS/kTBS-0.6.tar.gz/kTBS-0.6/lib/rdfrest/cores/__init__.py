I define the uniform interface of RDF-REST resources `ICore`:class:.

**Optimisation arguments.** Several of the methods defined in :class:`ICore`
have so called *optimisation arguments*. The caller can provide optimisation
arguments if they think they can help the implementation, by sparing it the work
of either checking data that is known to be correct, or re-computing data that
the caller already has. This puts a high responsibility on the caller, who
should only set those arguments *if they know for certain what they are doing*.
This is why those arguments have a default value and are semi-private (their
name begins with ``'_'``): typically, only subclasses of :class:`ICore`
should use them, and not in all circumstances.

On the other hand, implementations are free to ignore those arguments in
situations when they do not trust the caller (e.g. if it acts on behalf of
another program).

It follows that, when deriving mix-in classes atop the interfaces defined below,
implementors are faced with a delicate choice:

 * either let the implementation do all the checking and computation, which
   might be sub-optimal;
 * or do the checking and computation itself, which breaks the separation of
   concerns (TODO DOC link), and will duplicate work if the implementation
   decides not to trust the client (typically if the implementation is remote).

As a rule of thumb, mix-in implementors should therefore only use optimisation
arguments if they have the information at hand, or if they can quickly compute
it with information at hand. If they have to rely on the implementation (*i.e.*
call methods from the uniform interface), then they should rather let the
implementation do all the work and not use optimisation arguments.

    Abstract interface of an RDF-REST resource.

    .. py:attribute:: uri

        An attribute/property holding the URI of this resource.

    """

    uri = None

    def factory(self, uri, rdf_types=None, _no_spawn=False):
        """I return an instance for the resource identified by `uri`.

        If ``rdf_types`` is provided, the returned instance will inherit
        all the `registered <register_wrapper>`:meth: mix-in classes
        corresponding to those types.

        :param basestring uri: the URI of the resource to instanciate
        :rtype: :class:`ICore`
        :param rdf_types: if provided, a list of expected RDF types of the resource
        :type  rdf_types: list of :class:`rdflib.term.URIRef`

        Note that this method is only intended to access resources relying on
        the *same implementation* as self (i.e. "neighbour" resources). If this
        is not the case, it may return None even the resource identified by
        `uri` exists but is handled by a different implementation. For the
        latter case, :func:`.factory.factory` should be used instead.

        Optimisation arguments:

        :param _no_spawn: if True, only *pre-existing* python objects will be
                          returned (may not be honnored by all implementations)
        :type  _no_spawn: bool

        When using this function, it is a good practice to indicate the expected
        return type, either informally (with a comment) or formally, with a
        statement of the form::

            assert isinstance(returned_object, expected_mixin_class)

        Note however that most of the time,
        one can only know which :func:`registered wrapper<register_wrapper>` to expect,
        not the precise class.

        .. note::

            The interface defines this method as an instance method, so that
            additional method can rely on it to "navigate" from a resource to
            another, without prior knowledge of the destination resource.
            It is nonetheless a good idea, whenever possible, to make it a class
            method, so that the first instance can also be created that way.

        It follows that inside a so-called *trusted edit context*, methods of
        the resource can still safely be called, including :meth:`edit` itself.
        Edit context can therefore be embeded, as long as only the inner-most
        context is not trusted.

        NB: it is an error to set both *clear* and *_trust* to True.
