==================
Medical Procedures
==================

This module introduces the notion of a reusable medical procedure. Procedures
have a name, a code, an optional description, and an active flag that allows
them to be archived when they are no longer needed.

You can install this module independently, but it's not likely to be useful on
its own and should be installed automatically by any medical components that
require it.
