Sale Automatic Workflow
=======================

Create workflows with more or less automatization and apply it on sales
orders.

A workflow can:

- Apply default values:
  * Packing Policy (partial, complete)
  * Shipping Policy (prepaid, manual, postpaid, picking)
  * Invoice On (ordered quantities, shipped quantities)
  * Set the invoice's date to the sale order's date
  * Set a sales team

- Apply automatic actions:
  * Validate the order (only if paid, always, never)
  * Create an invoice
  * Validate the invoice
  * Confirm the picking

This module is used by Magentoerpconnect and Prestashoperpconnect.
It is well suited for other E-Commerce connectors as well.
