# Swoop -- Read and Write Autodesk Eagle Files in Python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NVSL/Swoop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NVSL/Swoop)

Swoop is a library of Python objects for representing and manipulating
Autodesk Eagle board, schematic, and library files used in designing printed
circuit boards (PCBs).  It parses an input Eagle file, creates a internal
representation data structure that represents the file's contents,
provides accessors and mutators to query, read, and modify those contents, and
generates valid Eagle files as output.
