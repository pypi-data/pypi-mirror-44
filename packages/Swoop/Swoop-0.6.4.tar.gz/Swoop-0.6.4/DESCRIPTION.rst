Swoop is a library of Python objects for representing and manipulating
Cadsoft Eagle board, schematic, and library files used in designing printed
circuit boards (PCBs).  It parses an input Eagle file, creates a internal
representation data structure that represents the file's contents,
provides accessors and mutators to query, read, and modify those contents, and
generates valid Eagle files as output.

Swoop was created by the `NVSL <http://nvsl.ucsd.edu/>`_ at `UCSD
<http://www.ucsd.edu/>`_ as part of the `Gadgetron project
<http://nvsl.ucsd.edu/index.php?path=projects/gadget>`_.
