=====================
Website Form Metadata
=====================

Odoo has the hidden and unused ability to gather metadata from the website
forms and record into the record created from such form. This module unveils
it.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to go to *Website Admin > Settings >
Advanced Settings* and set *Write Metadata* on.

Usage
=====

Fill a website form and check the metadata has been recorded. For instance:

#. Go to the *Contact form* and fill it.
#. Go to the created *Lead* or *Oportunity* and scroll down to the chatter. The
   metadata containing the origin IP address, user agent, accept language and
   referer should be written.
