# CLI tool for Hashicorp Vault

This tools allows simple interactions with the vault API, allowing
configuration to be done in a separate step using a YAML configuration file.

This is especially interesting if you interact with Hashicorp Vault from
automated deployment tools

## Installation

The tool is packaged but the package is not yet available on pypi.

`pip install vault-cli`

If you wish to use the hvac backend, install with

`pip install vault-cli[hvac]`

## Usage

```console
Usage: vault [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Interact with a Vault. See subcommands for details.

  All arguments can be passed by environment variables:
  VAULT_CLI_UPPERCASE_NAME (including VAULT_CLI_PASSWORD and
  VAULT_CLI_TOKEN).

Options:
  -U, --url TEXT               URL of the vault instance
  --verify / --no-verify       Verify HTTPS certificate
  --ca-bundle PATH             Location of the bundle containing the server
                               certificate to check against.
  -c, --certificate-file PATH  Certificate to connect to vault. Configuration
                               file can also contain a "certificate" key.
  -T, --token-file PATH        File which contains the token to connect to
                               Vault. Configuration file can also contain a
                               "token" key.
  -u, --username TEXT          Username used for userpass authentication
  -w, --password-file PATH     Can read from stdin if "-" is used as
                               parameter. Configuration file can also contain
                               a "password" key.
  -b, --base-path TEXT         Base path for requests
  --backend TEXT               Name of the backend to use (requests, hvac)
  -v, --verbose                Use multiple times to increase verbosity
  --config-file PATH           Config file to use. Use 'no' to disable config
                               file. Default value: first of ./.vault.yml,
                               ~/.vault.yml, /etc/vault.yml
  -h, --help                   Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  delete       Deletes a single secret.
  delete-all   Delete multiple secrets.
  dump-config  Displays settings in the format of a config file.
  env          Launches a command, loading secrets in environment.
  get          Return a single secret value.
  get-all      Return multiple secrets.
  list         List all the secrets at the given path.
  set          Set a single secret to the given value(s).
```

## Authentication

There are three ways to authenticate against the vault:
- Username and password file: provide a username and a file to read the
  password from. The file may be `-` for stdin.
- Certificate: provide the path to a certificate file. The file may also be
  read from stdin via `-`.
- Token: Bypass authentication step if you already have a valid token.

## Examples
```console
# Connect to https://vault.mydomain:8200/project and list the secrets
$ vault --url=https://vault.mydomain:8200 --certificate=/etc/vault/certificate.key --base-path=project/ list
['mysecret']

# Using the configuration file, get the value for my_secret (yaml format)
$ vault get my_secret
--- qwerty
...

# Same with only the value of the secret in plain text
$ vault get my_secret --text
qwerty

# Add another secret
$ vault set my_other_secret supersecret
Done

# Add a secret object
$ vault set --yaml blob_secret "{code: supercode}"
Done

# Get all values from the vault in a single command (yaml format)
$ vault get-all
---
my_secret: qwerty
my_other_secret: supersecret
blob_secret:
  code: supercode
test:
  my_folder_secret: sesame

# Get a nested secret based on a path
$ vault get-all test/my_folder_secret
test:
  my_folder_secret: sesame

# Get all values from a folder in a single command (yaml format)
$ vault get-all test my_secret
---
my_secret: qwerty
test:
  my_folder_secret: sesame

# Delete a secret
$ vault delete my_other_secret
Done

# Launch a process with all secrets from folder blob_secret as environment variables
$ vault env --path blob_secret -- env
...
code=supercode
...

# Recreate a configuration file based on the current settings
$ vault --url https://something --token mytoken dump-config > .vault.yaml

# Delete everything under blob-secret
$ vault delete-all blob-secret

# Delete everything, no confirmation
$ vault delete-all --force
```

## Configuration

The first file found in the following location is read, parsed and used:
1. `/etc/vault.yml`
2. `~/.vault.yml`
3. `./.vault.yml`

Any option passed as command line flag will be used over the corresponding
option in the documentation (use either `-` or `_`).

The expected format of the configuration is a mapping, with option names and
their corresponding values:

```yaml
---
username: my_username
password-file: ~/.vault-password
# or
token-file: ~/.vault-token
url: https://vault.mydomain:8200
verify: no
base-path: project/
...
```

Make sure the secret files have their permissions set accordingly.

For simple cases, you can directly define your `token` or `password` in the
file:

```yaml
---
username: my_username
password: secret-password
# or
token: secret-token
url: https://vault.mydomain:8200
verify: no
base-path: project/
...
```

If you do so, make sure the permissions of the configuration file itself are
not too broad

Just note that the `--verify / --no-verify` flag become `verify: yes` or
`verify: no`

All parameters can be defined from environment variables:

```console
$ VAULT_CLI_URL=https://myvault.com vault list
```
The name is always the uppercase underscored name of the equivalent command
line option. Token and password can also be passed as environment variables as
VAULT_CLI_TOKEN and VAULT_CLI_PASSWORD.

## State

The tool is currently in beta mode. It's missing docs, linting, and such.
