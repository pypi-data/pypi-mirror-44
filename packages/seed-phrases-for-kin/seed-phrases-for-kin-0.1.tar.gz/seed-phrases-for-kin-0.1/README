seed-phrases-for-kin
========================

This package provides a command-line script and a library module for
generating Kin accounts from BIP-0039/Electrum seed phrases. It
performs deterministic generation of Kin account keys from mnemonic
seed phrases. Each seed phrase may optionally be extended with custom
words that play the role of an additional passphrase.

seed-phrases-for-kin accepts two kinds of mnemonic seed phrases:

- seed phrases that comply with the BIP-0039 specification
  (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), and
  
- seed phrases generated by the Electrum Bitcoin wallet (https://electrum.org/).

Since these are the two major standards for wallet seed phrases,
seed-phrases-for-kin accepts nearly all mnemonic phrases generated by
cryptocurrency wallets. Note, however, that this software does NOT perform
random generation of high-entropy seed phrases. Its main purpose is to allow
cryptocurrency wallet users to derive Kin account keys from high-entropy
seed phrases that they already have and that probably were created by their
wallets.

By following either BIP-0039 or Electrum, `seed-phrases-for-kin`
derives a binary seed from a mnemonic seed phrase. Then it derives
Kin keys from the binary seed, as specified by SEP-0005
(https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0005.md),
SLIP-0010 (https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0010.md) and
BIP-0044 (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki).
