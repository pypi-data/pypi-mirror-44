use [Vue.js](https://www.vuejs.org) with pure Python

vue.py provides Python bindings for [Vue.js](https://www.vuejs.org).
It uses [brython](https://github.com/brython-dev/brython) to run Python in the browser.

Here is a simple example of an vue.py component
```python
from browser import alert
from vue import VueComponent

class HelloVuePy(VueComponent):
    greeting = "Hello vue.py"

    def greet(self, event):
        alert(self.greeting)

    template = """
    <button @click="greet">click me</button>
    """

HelloVuePy("#app")
```


## Development Status
The goal is to provide a solution to write fully-featured Vue applications in pure Python.

To get an overview what currently is supported, have a look at the [Documentation](https://stefanhoelzl.github.io/vue.py/docs/).

Have a look [here](https://stefanhoelzl.github.io/vue.py/planning.html) to see whats planned!

See also the [Limitations](https://stefanhoelzl.github.io/vue.py/docs/pyjs_bridge.html)

## Documentation
Documentation is available [here](https://stefanhoelzl.github.io/vue.py/docs/).

Examples can be found [here](https://stefanhoelzl.github.io/vue.py/examples).
These are vue.py versions of the [Vue.js examples](https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/)

## Performance
Initial loading times of `vue.py` apps can be very long.
Especially when loading a lot of python files.
Still figuring out how to solve this.

Have not done any peformance tests, but havent noticed any issues with performance
as soon as the app was fully loaded.

## Installation
```bash
$ pip install vuepy
```

## Development
Get the code
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stefanhoelzl/vue.py.git
$ cd vue.py
```

Install required python packages, the chromedriver for selenium and brython
```bash
$ make env.up
```

Start server (needed for tests)
```bash
$ make serve
```

Run tests
```bash
$ make tests          # runs all tets
$ make tests.unit     # runs unit tests
$ make test.selenium  # runs selenium tests
```

Clean up your working directory.
```bash
$ make env.clean
```

Reset your development environment
_(clean up, reinstall packages and redownload needed files)_
```bash
