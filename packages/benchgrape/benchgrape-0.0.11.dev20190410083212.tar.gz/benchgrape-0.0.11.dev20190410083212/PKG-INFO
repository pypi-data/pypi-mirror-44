        ## Installation
        
        ```
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        ```
        
        ## package installation on a linux machine (in virtualenv) for running the benchmark
        ```
        mkdir benchgrape
        cd benchgrape
        virtualenv -p python3 benchgrape
        source benchgrape/bin/activate
        cd benchgrape
        pip install --upgrade virtualenv
        pip install benchgrape
        benchgrape --help
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        This project includes a number of helpers in the `Makefile` to streamline common development tasks.
        
        Revert an installed package to continue development
        ```
        $ python setup.py develop
        ```
        
        ### Environment Setup
        
        The following demonstrates setting up and working with a development environment:
        
        ```
        ### create a virtualenv for development
        
        $ make virtualenv
        
        $ source env/bin/activate
        
        
        ### run benchgrape cli application
        
        $ benchgrape --help
        
        
        ### run pytest / coverage
        
        $ make test
        ```
        
        
        ### Releasing to PyPi
        
        Before releasing to PyPi, you must configure your login credentials:
        
        **~/.pypirc**:
        
        ```
        [pypi]
        username = YOUR_USERNAME
        password = YOUR_PASSWORD
        ```
        
        Then use the included helper function via the `Makefile`:
        
        ```
        $ make dist
        
        $ make dist-upload
        ```
        
        ## Deployments
        
        ### Docker
        
        Included is a basic `Dockerfile` for building and distributing `Bench Grape`,
        and can be built with the included `make` helper:
        
        ```
        $ make docker
        
        $ docker run -it benchgrape --help
        ```
         
        ## Examples
        ### Test Websocket Stability
        connect 10 websockets to staging.chatgrape.com and record 1 hour activity
        `benchgrape websocket test -n 10 -t 3600 --url https://staging.chatgrape.com --username chat@grape.com --password 'quote-if-special-chars'`
        
        ### Load Test data for Benchmark
        Test data can be exported on the grape server.
        `benchgrape test-data load localhost.json`
