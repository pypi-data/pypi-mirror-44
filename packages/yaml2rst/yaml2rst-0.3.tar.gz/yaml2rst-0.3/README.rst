This tool allows you writing documentation directly into YAML-files as
comments. These comments will then be converted to text and the YAML-code
goes into literal blocks.

This is some kind of `literate programming`, except that you do not
write code into your text, but text into your code. This difference
allows to process the YAML file directly without any pre-processing.


Usage::

  yaml2rst [-h] [--strip-regex regex] infile outfile

  positional arguments:
    infile               YAML-file to read (`-` for stdin)
    outfile              rst-file to write (`-` for stdout)

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help           show this help message and exit
    --strip-regex regex  Regex which will remove everything it matches. Can be
                         used to remove fold markers from headings for example.
                         Example to strip out [[[,]]] fold markers:
                         '\s*(:?\[{3}|\]{3})\d?$'. Check the README for more
                         details.


How it works
----------------

This script takes all lines beginning with :literal:`#\ ` (and lines
consisting of only a ``#``) as text-lines. Everything else will be
treated as "code". The text-lines will get the :literal:`#\ ` removed
and the "code" will get spaces prepended.

Additionally at the start and at the end of a "code"-block, lines are
added as required by reStructuredText. Also at the begin of a
"code"-block, a ``::`` is added if required.

``--strip-regex`` can be used to remove matching characters from text-lines
when needed. Refer to documentation about
`Folding marks support <docs/fold-markers.rst>`_ for details.


Examples
-------------

You can find example yaml-input, rst-output and generated html in the
examples directory. You may also view the generated html online at
https://rawgit.com/debops/yaml2rst/develop/examples/main.html.

  linting/checking/reformatting tool for YAML files documented with
  inline RST which goes hand in hand with yaml2rst.


Maintainers
---------------------

`yaml2rst` was originally developed 2015 and maintained by Hartmut
Goebel. In 2019 the project moved to the `debops` project for which
`yaml2rst` was developed.
