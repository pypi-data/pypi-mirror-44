# 1. List raster(s) to reduce. Lizard will be searched for each element.
# The list elements can be raster uuids, or search queries (the best match will be used).
# The first list element is used as scope for the spatial extent and temporal behaviour.
raster_layers:
    - Raster name / uuid 1
    - Raster name / uuid 2
# 2. List region hierarchy.
# This will reduce the rasters according to the indicated hierarchy.
# The last level in the hierarchy is used for the result(s).
# When multiple levels are indicated, the regional context per region will be identified.
# E.g. when supplying [0, Country, 1, Province, 3, Municipality] the result(s) will be
#      per municipality & indicate the province and country they are located in.
# Boundary IDs can be chosen from Lizard boundaries below, e.g. 1 for PROVINCE.
# Furthermore, boundary name aliases can be specified. 
# E.g. instead of [1, PROVINCE, you can use [1, Provinsi]
region_hierarchy:
    - [0, Country]
    - [1, Province]
# 3. Specify spatial reduce options
# TODO add stats type option, default is now area portion per class.
# stats_types: portions and areas, portions, areas
# stats_type: portions
# TODO add other spatial aggregation options.
# Defaults are now mean for continuous and counts for classes.
# reduce: mean
# TODO add option to normalize count results.
# i.e. scale coverage fractions to sum to 1
# normalize: False
# 4. Specify temporal reducer options
# temporal_type options: N/A, last_timesteps, range
temporal_type: last_timesteps
temporal_options:
    timesteps: 5
    start_date: 2015-01-01
    end_date: 2016-01-01
    custom_interval: False
    interval_days: 30
# 5. Specify export options
export_json: True
export_html: True
export_csv: True
export_name: dataframe
